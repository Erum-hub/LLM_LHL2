"If you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by Tom Robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole-hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art. The actors and the direction of this film are both good. <br /><br />The only trouble with the film, as I can see it, is that Robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond Hollywood's capabilities at the time this film was shot.<br /><br />Given both the irreverence of today's movies, as well as the willingness and abilityof today's audiences to delve into the bizarre, I think ""Even Cowgirls... would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released.",1,if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art  the actors and the direction of this film are both good   the only trouble with the film  as i can see it  is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywoods capabilities at the time this film was shot  given both the irreverence of todays movies  as well as the willingness and abilityof todays audiences to delve into the bizarre  i think  even cowgirls    would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released 
I saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and of course Mccomb. At that time I was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards I am trying for VCD of this film but I am unable to find it. Huge African lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them. All section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film. But some scenes involving Mccomb forces parental guidance for this film. It is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all.,1,i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb  it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb  at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it  huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them  all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film  but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film  it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all 
"I really loved this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the film, lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them. I can see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland, Sweden. The film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them. The music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring. Would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see - even people who don't normally go to subtitled films. Definitely deserved the Oscar Nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without pretension in a small-town community with everyday people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit.

"The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a two-piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching Tashan  the mega-disappointing, mind-numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend. Bad films are bad films and we see some every week, but Tashan is not just a bad film, it's a terrible film. Terrible because it takes its audience for granted, terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they've got big movie stars onboard.Written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, Tashan is what you'd describe as a road movie, but one that's going in all the wrong directions. Saif Ali Khan stars as Jimmy Cliff, a call-centre executive who's hired to teach English to Bhaiyyaji - that's Anil Kapoor playing an ambitious UP gangster, desperate to go cool. Jimmy's got his eye on Pooja, the gangster's pretty young assistant (played by Kareena Kapoor), who uses Jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees. Determined to recover his money and also to punish both Jimmy and Pooja, Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job. So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey, the gangster's faithful aide from Kanpur, who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that's hidden across the length and breadth of the country.Much like those bad eighties potboilers, Tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot. But the treatment's so over-the-top, so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect. Instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three-act structure, you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed. That garish item song in the desert, the bullet-dodging action scene at a Rajasthani fort, Kareeena's bikini moment, even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks, a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala, and believe it or not, even a Dhanno-style horse-driven tonga. In all fairness, not all these set pieces are badly done - the item song in the desert is quite neat actually - but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture, because you're just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really. Little do you expect in a seemingly fast-paced road movie, to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts.You see the problem with Tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making. What's more, I don't think they cared either - the film reeks of arrogance. Arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work, Tashan is like an overcooked stew.There are films that kill you softly, and then there's Tashan, a film that kills you with excess. Packaged snazzily with glossy-finish camera-work, exotic locations and fancy costumes, every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together, but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn't hold. Borrowing narrative from Tarantino and style from Stephen Chow doesn't help either because they don't blend with the film's wafer-thin plot. One may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging, but Anil Kapoor's grating Hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists, and Saif Ali Khan fumbles through the film foolishly, unable to find his feet. Kareena Kapoor, meanwhile, queen of over-the-top delivery, does a decent job. But of course, if Tashan is salvaged to some extent, it's thanks to Akshay Kumar's irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character. You cringe when he's cupping his crotch repeatedly, and you scowl when he delivers those double-meaning dialogues, but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he's up there.Despite some good music from Vishal-Shekhar, the songs seem like they're only prolonging your misery. Well that's because Tashan is a test of your patience. In case you didn't know, Tashan means style.

"I do regret that I have bought this series. I expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just boredom itself. I find the actors work quite weak as well. O'Donnell might seem charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he lacks any charm. Probably while he becomes older, he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. It comes as no surprise, that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.",0,i do regret that i have bought this series  i expected more action  more objective picture and more consistency  this is just a pure propaganda series  very dark  without any charm  or romanticism  it is just boredom itself  i find the actors work quite weak as well  odonnell might seem charming as robin  with batman   but in this picture he lacks any charm  probably while he becomes older  he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up  it comes as no surprise  that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40  of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands 
"I found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible.<br /><br />The only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was Lacy Chabert's performance who I thought played the multiple personalities really well. For me she was definitely the highlight of this movie.<br /><br />Dina Meyer was pretty as always but I found her role pretty bland so I don't think one can say that her acting was great.<br /><br />As for the male lead, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series.<br /><br />All of that I could have lived with.

"One of the biggest hits of 1926, Brown of Harvard is a exciting comedy/drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a major star. It's patented Haines all the way: brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man/hero and wins the girl. No one worked this formula like Haines. A terrific comic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression. He is a total joy in this film as he was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as the girl, Jack Pickford is very good as the sickly roommate, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams, and Grady Sutton co-star. This film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and for being John Wayne's film debut as a Yale football player (but I never spotted him). Haines was a top-five box office star starting with this picture through 1932. It's a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost. He was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time.",1,one of the biggest hits of 1926  brown of harvard is a exciting comedy drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star  its patented haines all the way  brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man hero and wins the girl  no one worked this formula like haines  a terrific comic actor  little annie rooney with mary pickford  show people with marion davies   haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression  he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines  with lon chaney  and west point  with joan crawford   where he repeats the formula  mary brian is good as the girl  jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate  ralph bushman is the rival  edward connelly  mary alden  david torrence  guinn williams  and grady sutton co star  this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john waynes film debut as a yale football player  but i never spotted him   haines was a top five box office star starting with this picture through 1932  its a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost  he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time 
"I found this a good movie to pass your time, but not by any chance of any historical value. The portrayal of Cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera.<br /><br />The twist of the facts is... funny! She gave birth while feeding her people!?!? O please... A pregnant Queen of Egypt (especially this one) would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason! They tried to make her appear a saint for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister... beyond description.<br /><br />Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals. She did everything for only two reasons: Power and self-preservation! She was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival, something she did very well. Anything that stood on her way was either murdered (her brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony).<br /><br />Unfortunately Octavian was too powerful to kill and too... gay to be seduced.

"This film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio-terrorism, and the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus, and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is fairly intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than serviceable in their roles. The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot. The actor in this film who most left his mark is Jack Palance. His sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface. The chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.",1,this film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio terrorism  and the threats of superbugs  west nile virus  and sars  as a thriller  the tension is fairly intense  richard widmark and paul douglas are more than serviceable in their roles  the domestic scenes between widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot  the actor in this film who most left his mark is jack palance  his sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface  the chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today  recommended  7 10

"Excellent, pre-code amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired (by writings of Nietzsche!) to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself, use men to her advantage. Not really fair on the German philosopher but interesting that this was the year Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here, ever driving herself and the film forward. Not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo. Great fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female. Still, that's life!",1,excellent  pre code amoral tale with barbara stanwyck as the newly inspired  by writings of nietzsche   to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself  use men to her advantage  not really fair on the german philosopher but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power  stanwyck  even in this young version doesnt do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here  ever driving herself and the film forward  not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo  great fun  if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female  still  thats life

"The Wicker Man Has Done The Impossible! It replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind. YES it's really that bad. So bad that when sitting down to write this review I thought to myself ""If I had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes"" I might actually go for the red hot needles.<br /><br />Neil LaBute created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind ""Yeah that's some bad direction right there"".<br /><br />I think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line: ""Some Sacrifices Must Be Made"". Sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen. Trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime..or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment. Seriously! The movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and I would still rather with be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice then find myself stranded there.<br /><br />The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. That's not a joke nor is it fictional. I've never been to a ""thriller"" and heard so much laughter through out the entire film. I can't tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly. I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater, anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia (soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films, write to your congressman today, don't delay). At one point I actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and Anna Ferris is going to show upoh how I wish.<br /><br />Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today. To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was a d*ck for slamming Nic's acting, oh he's still a d*ck just lesser of oneyes Sean Penn's d*ck was lessened because of this film. Do us all a favor Nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks. You cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars. His best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit (like the fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) then proceeds to run amok like Conan O'Brian's masturbating bear, but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around. Thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I just spoiled the ending for youand if you knew any better you'd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend. I sat through this crap-fest so you don't have to.<br /><br />About half way through this little misadventure I kept thinking to myself Jack Bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time..OK 35 minutes if Kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have figured this out in under an hourand you Sir are no Inspector Clouseau.<br /><br />If for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet, take the bullet.<br /><br />Somewhere Uwe Boll is laughing at us all.",0,the wicker man has done the impossible  it replaced cat woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind  yes its really that bad  so bad that when sitting down to write this review i thought to myself  if i had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes  i might actually go for the red hot needles  neil labute created a rare movie where joel schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind  yeah thats some bad direction right there   i think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line   some sacrifices must be made   sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen  trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime  or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment  seriously  the movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and i would still rather with be stuck on gilligans island with only pictures of condoleezza rice then find myself stranded there  the most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart ive ever heard in a movie theater  thats not a joke nor is it fictional  ive never been to a  thriller  and heard so much laughter through out the entire film  i cant tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly  i honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater  anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since deez  powder and i pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia  soon to be a law before all nic cage films  write to your congressman today  dont delay   at one point i actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and anna ferris is going to show upoh how i wish  nic cage throws out so much ham per frame im thinking of having a cholesterol test done today  to think that i ever thought sean penn was a d ck for slamming nics acting  oh hes still a d ck just lesser of oneyes sean penns d ck was lessened because of this film  do us all a favor nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks  you cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars  his best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit  like the fart  not a joke or a functional moment during this review  then proceeds to run amok like conan obrians masturbating bear  but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around  thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out hes to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of burning man and lilith fair  yes     i just spoiled the ending for youand if you knew any better youd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend  i sat through this crap fest so you dont have to  about half way through this little misadventure i kept thinking to myself jack bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time  ok 35 minutes if kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first  even steve martin as inspector clouseau could have figured this out in under an hourand you sir are no inspector clouseau  if for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet  take the bullet  somewhere uwe boll is laughing at us all

"The industry dropped the ball on this. The trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens. Had people had an opportunity to see this, work of mouth would have made it very successful. The 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters. I checked this out based on the rave recommendation Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens. Which gave it no chance to be seen. Some movies go to video quickly because they aren't that good. This is Oscar worthy and it's a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it. Maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on DVD or cable. If you haven't see this movie you should. Great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie. It could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films. Girl Interrupted comes to mind. If you like that you will like this. <br /><br />Both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic. Even though Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic. The movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better in this than in Traffic. I hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine. See this movie and if you like, recommend to friends so it doesn't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year. This movie was buried while Spiderman 2 tops records. What kind of word are we living in? AGHhh. So to make the world right again see this and recommend it.",1,the industry dropped the ball on this  the trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens  had people had an opportunity to see this  work of mouth would have made it very successful  the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters  i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard roeper or  ebert and roeper  in his book  an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens  which gave it no chance to be seen  some movies go to video quickly because they arent that good  this is oscar worthy and its a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it  maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable  if you havent see this movie you should  great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie  it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films  girl interrupted comes to mind  if you like that you will like this   both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic  even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic  the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school  erica is even better in this than in traffic  i hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine  see this movie and if you like  recommend to friends so it doesnt get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year  this movie was buried while spiderman 2 tops records  what kind of word are we living in  aghhh  so to make the world right again see this and recommend it 
"It's been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad.. The acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and I'm at a loss for words as to the execution. It was completely unoriginal. O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood's a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /><br />One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might never happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.",0,its been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad   the acting is very average  the story is horribly boring  and im at a loss for words as to the execution  it was completely unoriginal  o  and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwoods a pregnant schwarzenegger   one of the first scenes  the one with the television show   where the hell are you   got it right   the cast was 80  of lets face it   forgotten actors  if they were hoping for a career relaunch  then i think it might never happen with this on their cv  the script had the potential  but neither 80  of the actors nor the director  whos an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor  pulled it off  fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest  im sorry  but if you ever consider watching this   i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic  because not only its a total loss of time  but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like 
"It's interesting that all who (so far) seemed to like this film had no expectations--I guess that's the trick. In contrast with them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close to the faces the camera always was, I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director--that's always a clear sign of them, they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors. The actors in this film, though, had only one facial expression each. <br /><br />If the close camera wasn't enough, the lack of light in the film killed it. The film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark. So now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur, as well. ""Ooh ooh, we're going to light the set with a flashlight! That will make it all seem intimate!"" No, that made it all seem invisible.<br /><br />On top of the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated. (Perhaps this is a new kind of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget about it.)<br /><br />The fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film, but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals. I can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where I saw it. In fact, two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's ""total darkness"" technique). But when the film shuddered on, instead, there were moans coming from the audience. And once the movie finally DID end, it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points. An earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yeah, we get it, the life of the lonely old man was boring-- but we figured that one out at the very beginning.<br /><br />I recommend that audiences miss this one, it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goers.",0,its interesting that all who  so far  seemed to like this film had no expectations  i guess thats the trick  in contrast with them  i had optimistic expectations  and that was a mistake  as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was  i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director  thats always a clear sign of them  they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors  the actors in this film  though  had only one facial expression each   if the close camera wasnt enough  the lack of light in the film killed it  the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark  so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur  as well   ooh ooh  were going to light the set with a flashlight  that will make it all seem intimate   no  that made it all seem invisible  on top of the serious technical flaws  there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed  and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated   perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany  but in los angeles  forget about it   the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesnt indicate the quality of the film  but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals  i can assure you that this film wont win anything in the festival where i saw it  in fact  two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave  this was one of the side effects of the cinematographers  total darkness  technique   but when the film shuddered on  instead  there were moans coming from the audience  and once the movie finally did end  it was clear that it hadnt mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points  an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity  folding sheets  cutting vegetables  spreading honey on bread   yeah  we get it  the life of the lonely old man was boring   but we figured that one out at the very beginning  i recommend that audiences miss this one  it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie goers 
"It helps if you understand Czech and can see this in the original language and understand the Czechs obsession with 'The Professionals', but if not, 'Jedna ruka netlaska' is yet another great Czech film. It is funny, dark and extremely enjoyable. The highest compliment I can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing.<br /><br />For a small country the Czech Republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel, Sverak and numerous others. Czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it. This film is just that, it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings, but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise, good intent and optimism.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved in. Enjoy it, it's a film made for just that reason - anyway, it's as close as the Czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending...",1,it helps if you understand czech and can see this in the original language and understand the czechs obsession with the professionals  but if not  jedna ruka netlaska is yet another great czech film  it is funny  dark and extremely enjoyable  the highest compliment i can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing  for a small country the czech republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature  from hrabal  hasek and kundera to the films of menzel  sverak and numerous others  czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising  but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it  this film is just that  it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings  but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise  good intent and optimism  i highly recommend this and most other projects trojan and machacek are involved in  enjoy it  its a film made for just that reason   anyway  its as close as the czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending   
"It's just breathtaking in it's awfulness-- you really must see it!<br /><br />Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either the savior or the problem here: since he's the only one on screen that can actually get his lines out with something akin to natural cadences and inflection, he either ruins the movie by pointing up everyone else's flaws, or he saves it by providing some context for their awfulness.<br /><br />I'm inclined to the later view-- thanks to him, it works as high comedy. He's the 7 footer in a game of dwarf basketball, his skill set just doesn't apply in this context, and his discombobulation is delicious.<br /><br />The real treat though is Ms. Eastwood, whose inability to speak in plain English is so pervasive I actually googled her, expecting to learn that she was a Russian beauty who pronounced her lines phonetically, with no understanding of their meaning. But no: she's just a talent free American who will leave you laughing with every line she drops.

"I had never heard of this one before the owner of my local DVD rental outlet mentioned it to me; being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the U.K., I decided to check it out. The film turned out be a dull, amateurish and ugly-looking ride; the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time, whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept! <br /><br />What’s worse, the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings. Soon, one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again; another, still bed-ridden, is quickly disposed of (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a bible-thumping mother (cue horrendous overacting), her repressed (and long-suffering) daughter, and the latter’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests.<br /><br />Often resorting to dinner-table reminiscences by the man-hating mother (as a means of filling in the dreary, to say nothing of unoriginal, backstory) and which invariably develop into mother-daughter sparring contests, the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film (as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore) or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time...",0,i had never heard of this one before the owner of my local dvd rental outlet mentioned it to me  being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the u k   i decided to check it out  the film turned out be a dull  amateurish and ugly looking ride  the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time  whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept   what’s worse  the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings  soon  one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again  another  still bed ridden  is quickly disposed of  after being forgotten for most of the duration   the heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house  a harridan of a bible thumping mother  cue horrendous overacting   her repressed  and long suffering  daughter  and the latter’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests  often resorting to dinner table reminiscences by the man hating mother  as a means of filling in the dreary  to say nothing of unoriginal  backstory  and which invariably develop into mother daughter sparring contests  the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious  but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film  as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore  or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time   
"As the front cover says ""The hamlet of our time, for our time"".<br /><br />I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was truly a disappointing experience.<br /><br />This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60's) this was a very well done version of Hamlet but cannot compare to Branagh's complete version.<br /><br />just a note... I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists.

"It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still wouldn't recommend this movie.",0,it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance  the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it  the production was good  however  the script and acting were b movie quality  the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors  the good actors didnt hold their own nor did they lift up the others   this movie is not worthy of more words  but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines  james wood and cuba gooding  jr  play caricatures of themselves in other movies   if you are looking for mindless entertainment  i still wouldnt recommend this movie 
"Updating of the Bliss theme is merely the latest in a lengthening queue of bad-to-average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema-going set. (For the record, this list, all of the films on which appear to be attempting a Castle-esque miracle, includes, Strange Bedfellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Eggs, The Honourable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes and The Nugget. The only one to have worked has been Crackerjack.)<br /><br />Here, the performances never mesh, as John Howard doesn't even look like he's in the right film  though perhaps that was the intention, as Franklin plays sleepy, conservative suburbia against its more interesting inhabitants. 20-year-old virgins who live with their parents are becoming rarer on-screen, but this is hardly a reason to watch the film. In fact, the only reasons may well be (1) Howard's bizarre  but quite fun  performance, and (2) the 'suburban nightmare' theme, which has run through Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandra's Project, Danny Deckchair, The Rage in Placid Lake, Traveling Light, Teesh & Trude, Swimming Upstream and Lantana, many of which are very good/excellent.

"This extremely weak Australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the Pavlov Dog Experiment amongst horror movies. You remember this famous ""Conditioned Reflex"" experiment from your school books, right? The Russian scientist Pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal's reflexes. Pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and, after a while, he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell. What the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low-budgeted Aussie slasher flick, I hear you think? Well, the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in ""Nightmares"" is an exact variant on Pavlov's experiment. Each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window, because he/she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims. So this means that, after a short while, inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass. That way they still don't miss anything special! <br /><br />Regarding the quality of ""Nightmares"" as a film I can be very brief. This is a cheap, uninspired and largely imbecilic Aussie cash-in on the contemporary popular trend of American slasher movies. In the early 60's, a four-year-old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident. Twenty years later the same girl  Helen Selleck  is a successful stage actress, but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares. She auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part. Shortly after the big premiere, everyone who's even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered. It is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer's identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already. I don't think I've ever seen a more obvious whodunit than ""Nightmares"" and the creators should have just showed his/her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment. The murders are explicit and very bloody and there's also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to ""enjoy"". However, the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative. The few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage. The only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic, whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do. ""Nightmares"" is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema, but hey, at least I gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible.",0,this extremely weak australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the pavlov dog experiment amongst horror movies  you remember this famous  conditioned reflex  experiment from your school books  right  the russian scientist pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animals reflexes  pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and  after a while  he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell  what the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low budgeted aussie slasher flick  i hear you think  well  the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in  nightmares  is an exact variant on pavlovs experiment  each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window  because he she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims  so this means that  after a short while  inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass  that way they still dont miss anything special   regarding the quality of  nightmares  as a film i can be very brief  this is a cheap  uninspired and largely imbecilic aussie cash in on the contemporary popular trend of american slasher movies  in the early 60s  a four year old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident  twenty years later the same girl  helen selleck  is a successful stage actress  but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares  she auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part  shortly after the big premiere  everyone whos even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered  it is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killers identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already  i dont think ive ever seen a more obvious whodunit than  nightmares  and the creators should have just showed his her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment  the murders are explicit and very bloody and theres also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to  enjoy   however  the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative  the few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage  the only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic  whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do   nightmares  is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema  but hey  at least i gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible 
"I am quite a fan of novelist/screenwriter Michael Chabon. His novel ""Wonder Boys"" became a fantastic movie by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years back, and he had a hand in the script of ""Spider Man 2"", arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time.<br /><br />Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces, such as the gut-busting ""Dodgeball"" and the genius short film series ""Terry Tate: Office Linebacker"". And with a cast including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, this seems like a no-brainer.<br /><br />It is. Literally.<br /><br />Jon Foster stars as Art Bechstein, the son of a mobster (Nolte) who recently graduated with a degree in Economics. Jon is in a state of arrested development: he works a minimum wage job at Book Barn, has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend/boss, Phlox (Suvari), which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex, with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion.<br /><br />One night at a party, an ex-roommate introduces Jon to Jane (Miller), a beautiful, smart violinist. Later that night they go out for pie, and she asks Jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence, ""I want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul. If you do, it will make this night indelible."" Jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by, yet none of them look him in the eye. ""I imagine it must be what death feels like,"" he says.<br /><br />The next day Jane's wild boyfriend Cleveland (Saarsgard) kidnaps Jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill, and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts, doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol. This doesn't sit well with Phlox, who pushes Jon for a more personal relationship, namely letting her meet his new friends and his father. The film then attempts to take us on Jon's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father, Phlox and his dead-end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane.<br /><br />There is a problem having us follow Jon throughout the film: he's completely uninteresting. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to Jane the night they met. At the outset this isn't a problem. But he never gets any more interesting. He's a completely passive character. He simply follows along the bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself.<br /><br />Consequently, the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party, have sex and get in arguments. In other words, much ado about nothing. What we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside. Sweeping cinematography, ponderous voice-over with characters staring off into the distance, lots of sex scenes both straight and gay, big arguments, more angry sex, a chase scene and a tragic death... but it doesn't seem to matter. Ironically, at one point Jane, confused at a number of Jon's aimless actions, asks him, ""What's going on, Jon? What is this all about?"" Yes, Jon, do tell. We in the audience are dying to know, too.<br /><br />The title ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"" must refer to the characters themselves, because that's what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional stand-ins for actual people. The film never lets us in. We never know what makes any of them tick. We see them do lots of things, but we don't know why. And the absence of ""why"" is one of the worst things a movie can have.",0,i am quite a fan of novelist screenwriter michael chabon  his novel  wonder boys  became a fantastic movie by curtis hanson  his masterful novel  the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay  won the pulitzer prize a few years back  and he had a hand in the script of  spider man 2   arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time  director rawson marshall thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces  such as the gut busting  dodgeball  and the genius short film series  terry tate  office linebacker   and with a cast including peter saarsgard  sienna miller  nick nolte and mena suvari  this seems like a no brainer  it is  literally  jon foster stars as art bechstein  the son of a mobster  nolte  who recently graduated with a degree in economics  jon is in a state of arrested development  he works a minimum wage job at book barn  has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend boss  phlox  suvari   which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex  with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion  one night at a party  an ex roommate introduces jon to jane  miller   a beautiful  smart violinist  later that night they go out for pie  and she asks jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence   i want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul  if you do  it will make this night indelible   jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by  yet none of them look him in the eye   i imagine it must be what death feels like   he says  the next day janes wild boyfriend cleveland  saarsgard  kidnaps jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill  and soon jon  cleveland and jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts  doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol  this doesnt sit well with phlox  who pushes jon for a more personal relationship  namely letting her meet his new friends and his father  the film then attempts to take us on jons journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father  phlox and his dead end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with cleveland and jane  there is a problem having us follow jon throughout the film  hes completely uninteresting  he has no ambitions  passions or goals  he walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to jane the night they met  at the outset this isnt a problem  but he never gets any more interesting  hes a completely passive character  he simply follows along the bohemian cleveland and jane  but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself  consequently  the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party  have sex and get in arguments  in other words  much ado about nothing  what we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside  sweeping cinematography  ponderous voice over with characters staring off into the distance  lots of sex scenes both straight and gay  big arguments  more angry sex  a chase scene and a tragic death    but it doesnt seem to matter  ironically  at one point jane  confused at a number of jons aimless actions  asks him   whats going on  jon  what is this all about   yes  jon  do tell  we in the audience are dying to know  too  the title  the mysteries of pittsburgh  must refer to the characters themselves  because thats what they are  they are all facades  one dimensional stand ins for actual people  the film never lets us in  we never know what makes any of them tick  we see them do lots of things  but we dont know why  and the absence of  why  is one of the worst things a movie can have 
"This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film. (I believe that Lucille Ball may have modeled her later career on Davies' style, that could be termed ""zany beauty"".) Vidor's direction is light but sure-handed, the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary, and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era, with many cameos, adds to the overall fun. It combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well. For all movie fans who have a knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films, sit through this one and it may change your attitude. <br /><br />",1,this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies  she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film   i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies style  that could be termed  zany beauty    vidors direction is light but sure handed  the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary  and the star watching element for fans of the silent era  with many cameos  adds to the overall fun  it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well  for all movie fans who have a knee jerk reaction to watching silent films  sit through this one and it may change your attitude 
"Sadly, more downs than ups. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. The other good thing was the cast. I'm not saying that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.<br /><br />One of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was quite boring. Another down (or you could consider it an up if you want) is the excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'.<br /><br />Unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of Debbie Rochon, than this is the movie for you.

"Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. His juvenile jokes, silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world. A lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him, and he was never completely comfortable in films. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has been tailored to make the most of his talents, but Askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />Askey's support in the film is not strong, it includes regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a dopey honeymoon couple; Linden Travers going over the top as a 'mad woman'. Also on board are Peter Murray-Hill, who off-screen married Phyllis Calvert, as the nominal leading man, giving a totally bland reading of the part, and leading lady Carol Lynne, who turns in an equally insipid performance. It is left to character actress Kathleen Harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on Dr Morland Graham's brandy.",0,arthur askeys great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public  his juvenile jokes  silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world  a lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him  and he was never completely comfortable in films  he has his moments in the ghost train  and his character  tommy gander  has been tailored to make the most of his talents  but askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated  askeys support in the film is not strong  it includes regular co star richard murdoch  betty jardine and stuart latham as a dopey honeymoon couple  linden travers going over the top as a mad woman  also on board are peter murray hill  who off screen married phyllis calvert  as the nominal leading man  giving a totally bland reading of the part  and leading lady carol lynne  who turns in an equally insipid performance  it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on dr morland grahams brandy 
"A mock documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together, despite a number of conflicting threads.<br /><br />Hollywood North works as a film in a way very similar to why This Is Spinal Tap (1984) works so well. Namely, although exaggerated in some ways, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists of ""behind the scenes"" facts that are very different than the public face of the industry. It isn't easy to make a film, and it must have been especially difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Films involve tens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have incompatible desires, motivations and personalities. Especially crucial are the financiers and the on-screen talent, as if either drops out or becomes undependable at any stage while the film is in production, it could jeopardize the whole affair, either necessitating extensive reshoots or abandoning the film altogether.<br /><br />So it's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on those kinds of relationships. The result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. The script is flawless and the performances are top notch. This is a must-see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film-making. It should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor.<br /><br />A 10 out of 10 from me.",1,a mock documentary about a pair of canadian producers  bobby myers  matthew modine  and paul linder  saul rubinek   trying to make their first film in the late 1970s  hollywood north is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together  despite a number of conflicting threads  hollywood north works as a film in a way very similar to why this is spinal tap  1984  works so well  namely  although exaggerated in some ways  it is very close to the truth  and the truth consists of  behind the scenes  facts that are very different than the public face of the industry  it isnt easy to make a film  and it must have been especially difficult in canada in the late 1970s  films involve tens  if not hundreds  of people  many have incompatible desires  motivations and personalities  especially crucial are the financiers and the on screen talent  as if either drops out or becomes undependable at any stage while the film is in production  it could jeopardize the whole affair  either necessitating extensive reshoots or abandoning the film altogether  so its not surprising that hollywood north focuses on those kinds of relationships  the result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time  the script is flawless and the performances are top notch  this is a must see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film making  it should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor  a 10 out of 10 from me

"Though I never like to be the sort of person who negates another's personal taste; if you like something, that's fine. But, this movie was horrible and there is no way around it. I don't like Ani Difranco too much, but she's a great guitarist and songwriter, that I can admit. But I can't admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film. Many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face. Maybe, but everything is portrayed too far-fetched. There seems to be an attempt at a ""Naked Gun"" - esque kind of comedy, but the timing is off; there is too much space between each actors line, as if they're holding for laughter (there wasn't any). Whoever wrote the script was all over the place. They tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film, almost never fully developing any of them (especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher). I did not laugh once throughout this entire movie. I was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen.",0,though i never like to be the sort of person who negates anothers personal taste  if you like something  thats fine  but  this movie was horrible and there is no way around it  i dont like ani difranco too much  but shes a great guitarist and songwriter  that i can admit  but i cant admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film  many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face  maybe  but everything is portrayed too far fetched  there seems to be an attempt at a  naked gun    esque kind of comedy  but the timing is off  there is too much space between each actors line  as if theyre holding for laughter  there wasnt any   whoever wrote the script was all over the place  they tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film  almost never fully developing any of them  especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher   i did not laugh once throughout this entire movie  i was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen 
"I had to walk out of the theater. After an hour, all I was seeing was people cheating on wives, schtupping like dogs in a rut, and using the f-word like a diabetic using Equal.<br /><br />No thanks.<br /><br />It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. Any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate, talk about it, and swear at each other.<br /><br />The few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. Plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1)several murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees murder scene 3) Vinnie stares moodily across Atlantic/East/Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on wife, and 5) Joey (most sympathetic character in the show) gets kicked out of his parents' house. More than that, I didn't wait to see.<br /><br />The photography and the interplay between the characters were superb, but THERE WAS NOTHING for them to DO. The flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for SOMETHING to happen.<br /><br />Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill, or Shawshank Redemption.

"When I was chairman of our college's coffeehouse, one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come along in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that it was being shown off-off Broadway in theaters where television monitors were being placed throughout the audience, so everyone had a great seat. The premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis-ala Saturday Night Live, keeping the thing fresh. They decided on making it into a film for general distribution.<br /><br />I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on film. Watching him run naked though the woods was a howl. Like many of the reviews before mine, it WAS Saturday Night Live before such a thing existed. I highly recommend this vid.

"I must say that, looking at Hamlet from the perspective of a student, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded. It helps the play come to life on screen, and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching, as we did while studying it, to follow and analyze the text.<br /><br />One of the things I have heard criticized many times is the casting of major Hollywood names in the play. I find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier, as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare.<br /><br />Also, his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text. Such as how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really went and why Fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end. All in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that one does not have to be an English Literature Ph.D to understand and enjoy it.",1,i must say that  looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student  brannaghs version of hamlet is by far the best  his dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded  it helps the play come to life on screen  and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching  as we did while studying it  to follow and analyze the text  one of the things i have heard criticized many times is the casting of major hollywood names in the play  i find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier  as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespeare  also  his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text  such as how far the relationship between hamlet and ophelia really went and why fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end  all in all  not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with shakespeare  it is presented in a way that one does not have to be an english literature ph d to understand and enjoy it

"Although there are some snippets in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform, these are not very well-developed, in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.<br /><br />Although this program, as a whole, leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money, and for that it deserves some praise, almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to--very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you, if asked, they think the drug war is designed to solve. For example, while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80's, at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law, forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence, the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. Inexplicably, alcohol prohibition, the violence that ensued, and the subsequent reversal of prohibition, is totally ignored by this program.<br /><br />This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems, but not all users do their drugs in excess, just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.<br /><br />If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government, for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science, has decided to totally prohibit, whose users it has decided to not-so-metaphorically wage war against, just forget about it. None of that is in here.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is hardly in the category of anti-drug propaganda. It is mostly an interesting neutrally-presented history of drugs in 20th century United States like marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and Oxycontin. But there is a significant element of various people's points of view with regard to drug laws, and most (but not all) of that is not very thoughtful or well-informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality, especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. <br /><br />The criminal justice system, along with its often harsh life-ruining penalties, is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem, but unfortunately there's an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs, a lack of compassion for fellow humans, a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally-approved, perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry, and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. It's morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so, and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs, yet this program ignores it.<br /><br />So, in sum, the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. But when it comes to presenting a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy, and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives, it's pretty disappointing.",0,although there are some snippets in this 4 part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform  these are not very well developed  in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs  although this program  as a whole  leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money  and for that it deserves some praise  almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to  very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you  if asked  they think the drug war is designed to solve  for example  while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80s  at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law  forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business  but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence  the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame  inexplicably  alcohol prohibition  the violence that ensued  and the subsequent reversal of prohibition  is totally ignored by this program  this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users  and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war  the possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on  use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems  but not all users do their drugs in excess  just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics  if you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government  for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science  has decided to totally prohibit  whose users it has decided to not so metaphorically wage war against  just forget about it  none of that is in here  on the other hand  this is hardly in the category of anti drug propaganda  it is mostly an interesting neutrally presented history of drugs in 20th century united states like marijuana  lsd  heroin  cocaine  mdma  and oxycontin  but there is a significant element of various peoples points of view with regard to drug laws  and most  but not all  of that is not very thoughtful or well informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality  especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana   the criminal justice system  along with its often harsh life ruining penalties  is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem  but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an as yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs  a lack of compassion for fellow humans  a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally approved  perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison policing industry  and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity  its morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so  and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason  this is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs  yet this program ignores it  so  in sum  the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining  but when it comes to presenting a rational non radical point of view with regard to drug policy  and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives  its pretty disappointing 
"In the hands of a more skilled director, this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece. Despite Michael ""Death Wish"" Winner's merely passable direction, the movie is interesting, original and more than a little scary.<br /><br />The script bucks more than one horror cliché off its back (several it can't shake) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down. Burgess Meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor. Eva Gardner is haunting with a young Beverly D'Angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine does a heck-of-a job sitting in a chair. And watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown-at-the-time Chris Walken! This movie is creepy and creative. The plot twists are lovely, if a tad predictable. The climax, of which I will give no detail, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again a better director could have done more with it, nonetheless it is quite satisfying - at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror.<br /><br />If you like modern overproduced body-counting torture-fantasy, you won't like this. There is almost no gore. The direction is quite spartan. The effects are few, although there's some delightful makeup near the end - most of which actually isn't makeup...but perhaps I've said too much already.<br /><br />I've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify, but I enjoyed it as much as any ""8"" film that I've seen.",1,in the hands of a more skilled director  this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece  despite michael  death wish  winners merely passable direction  the movie is interesting  original and more than a little scary  the script bucks more than one horror cliché off its back  several it cant shake  including chris sarandon as the heroines boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down  burgess meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor  eva gardner is haunting with a young beverly dangelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover  john carradine does a heck of a job sitting in a chair  and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown at the time chris walken  this movie is creepy and creative  the plot twists are lovely  if a tad predictable  the climax  of which i will give no detail  is disturbing and quite impressive  again a better director could have done more with it  nonetheless it is quite satisfying   at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror  if you like modern overproduced body counting torture fantasy  you wont like this  there is almost no gore  the direction is quite spartan  the effects are few  although theres some delightful makeup near the end   most of which actually isnt makeup   but perhaps ive said too much already  ive rated this a little higher than its quality may justify  but i enjoyed it as much as any  8  film that ive seen 
"Will Smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts!!! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian Director Gabriele Muccino come together and created a masterpiece that I highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching/feeling this film!!! I have the Highest Respects for Will Smith as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film. You will find yourself feeling his pain and anger, the frustrations over his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who by the way was Fantastic as usual. I found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love. Woody Harrelson also stars in this Top Notch film. I find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points...All I can say is, Watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you, take the phone off the hook, sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of IRS Agent Ben Thomas...I thank you Will Smith for another Great Film!!!",1,will smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts    writer grant nieporte and italian director gabriele muccino come together and created a masterpiece that i highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching feeling this film    i have the highest respects for will smith as he is not only a brilliant actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character  irs agent ben thomas  he played in this film  you will find yourself feeling his pain and anger  the frustrations over his love for emily  played by rosario dawson  who by the way was fantastic as usual  i found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love  woody harrelson also stars in this top notch film  i find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points   all i can say is  watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you  take the phone off the hook  sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of irs agent ben thomas   i thank you will smith for another great film   
"Wow... I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story's I've ever had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and his son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And 16 year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, thats just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for ""stealling"" their loved ones. And speaking of loved ones, I've lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been his fiancée, Akane. And thats just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series.<br /><br />The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so... so... out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable... I can't even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story thats so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humor. Not once have I laughed out loud this much from a manga, and it doesn't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson's or something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to end. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo... with every little problem the story throws at him he's doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to ever live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct! But whenever he does have some spotlight... he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! You think you know the worst dad ever from an anime? You haven't met Genma. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma's greatest rivals and my favorite character (next to Ranma)... and probably one of the only people he can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault... is his lack of sense in direction! Then we have... you know, I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story's, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless.<br /><br />Check out the series if you haven't, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I've had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humor doesn't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. But either way, its a win win! 10 out of 10!",1,wow    i mean wow this has got to be one of the best storys ive ever had the chance to read watch  we all know this famous story  two martial artist  a man and his son  go to train in the forbidden cursed springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each  the dad  genma  the spring of drowned panda  and 16 year old ranma  the spring of drowned girl  now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in  crazy enough yet  no  thats just the beginning  as if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasnt enough  ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles  an insane high school principle  opponents right and left who have a score to settle with ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for  stealling  their loved ones  and speaking of loved ones  ive lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with ranma  and not once has it been his fiancée  akane  and thats just from the first few chapters episodes of the series  the story itself is amazing  i have never come across something so crazy  so bizarre  so    so    out of this world and yet its so down to earth and believable    i cant even describe it to its fullest  its just a charming story thats so easy to get into  what i like about it is the humor  not once have i laughed out loud this much from a manga  and it doesnt have to try any of the stunts you would catch in simpsons or something of the sort  i could read any part of the comic and i would be laughing from beginning to end  another thing is the characters  ranma  you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo    with every little problem the story throws at him hes doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius  and to think  of the hundreds of perverts in the show  ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town  more so by akane  the worst pervert to ever live  his father genma  you would think the father character would blend in to the background right  correct  but whenever he does have some spotlight    he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him  you think you know the worst dad ever from an anime  you havent met genma  ryoga  probably one of ranmas greatest rivals and my favorite character  next to ranma     and probably one of the only people he can actually stand  most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults  one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault    is his lack of sense in direction  then we have    you know  i could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters  the storys  everything positive about it but that would be just pointless  check out the series if you havent  now  you will not regret it  though i would advise checking the comic out first  i like the anime  but ive had some trouble getting the series at a good price  and a small nitpick  the humor doesnt seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga  i think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me  but either way  its a win win  10 out of 10 
"I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*). It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle ""Coxism State"" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase/or is that Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on Conan).

"Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies. They get to be same ol'-same ol'. Same ol' pack every minute with some cheap thrill (usually 'splatter') and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects. One of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience. For instance, I saw both of the recent Mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second. It probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended, it grew roots.<br /><br />Subtlety can be more terrifying. Less is more. <br /><br />I first saw 'The Woman in Black' on the A&E channel. After flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television I stopped to watch it. This movie almost has the feel of a 'Masterpiece Theater' production. That was fine with me, I've always preferred British TV & movies anyway.<br /><br />Most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced. But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility. The special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy. The makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable. Hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes-fangs-claws etc. Hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity.<br /><br />The woman only makes about five appearances in the film. Most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright. If she appeared too often, it could've cheapened the mood that gets set. However this movie is so well made that through much of the film we're led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible. The scene where she 'visits' Arthur Kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror.<br /><br />This is just an extraordinary film that I think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made. I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and a zillion more. I haven't seen anything that tops 'The Woman in Black' yet although I'm still looking. This movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic (like me) a moment where I almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts. I joke to people that I occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that I'd see her staring through my window, etc. Maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate. This is how a really great horror film should be. Like a LaFanu novel, The Woman in Black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it, she's squeezing the life out of you and then it's too late.<br /><br />Closest thing I have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen... and it's a terrible shame that this is out of print. I just paid over $40 for my second copy of this movie. It's a major prize in my collection. Now I'm on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama.",1,most horror movies are in fact horrible movies  they get to be same ol same ol  same ol pack every minute with some cheap thrill  usually splatter  and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects  one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience  for instance  i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second  it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended  it grew roots  subtlety can be more terrifying  less is more   i first saw the woman in black on the a e channel  after flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it  this movie almost has the feel of a masterpiece theater production  that was fine with me  ive always preferred british tv   movies anyway  most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced  but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility  the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy  the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable  hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes fangs claws etc  hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity  the woman only makes about five appearances in the film  most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright  if she appeared too often  it couldve cheapened the mood that gets set  however this movie is so well made that through much of the film were led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible  the scene where she visits arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror  this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made  i have a copy of the haunting  the changling and a zillion more  i havent seen anything that tops the woman in black yet although im still looking  this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic  like me  a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non existence of ghosts  i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that id see her staring through my window  etc  maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate  this is how a really great horror film should be  like a lafanu novel  the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it  shes squeezing the life out of you and then its too late  closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen    and its a terrible shame that this is out of print  i just paid over  40 for my second copy of this movie  its a major prize in my collection  now im on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama 
"This has got to be the most stupid film I have ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. We find that the kid has a gift, the ""Shining"". This gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool. Then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. He goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because... well, he feels like it. Why else would he do it? All of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse, which is utterly disgusting. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe. Then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. Most movies aren't a complete waste of time, but this falls right into that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring. This movie is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.

"This second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen. Then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them. We know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to speak of the car. And that is what happens. Now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film. That he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how is he going to get out of it? That's what you must discover by yourself. And don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story. A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he is going to be wounded. They did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days. It's true recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them, to do them.

"I happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon. I have to admit that I've never been a big baseball fan, but I can sometimes get into a good sports-related movie. What I found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system. As a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system, I though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from family to family, biological parents not always taking an active involvement, and transitions that can be but heart-wrenching and heart-melting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film, and both bring very believable performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film.",1,i happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon  i have to admit that ive never been a big baseball fan  but i can sometimes get into a good sports related movie  what i found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system  as a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system  i though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system  people jumping from family to family  biological parents not always taking an active involvement  and transitions that can be but heart wrenching and heart melting  joseph gordon levitt and danny glover are the anchor of this film  and both bring very believable performances  maybe it was just my emotional state  but i did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film

"Set in World Depression Era Prague, this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop, who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague. Add a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart- is having an affair with the owner's wife), leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' Stewart all along, the happy ending is inevitable.<br /><br />Although VERY dated (references to poverty and -I have a wife and two kids to consider- are over-used, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out-of-reach for common people's enjoyment), this film is much more effective (and more credible) than the 1990s re-make ""You've Got Mail"". In the re-make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual odds of the chain-of-events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended.<br /><br />""Shop Around The Corner"" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's Utopia.

"The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded admirably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much more believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.",1,the whole point of making this film  one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera  was to make it more accessible to the masses  and it succeeded admirably in doing so  the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly  hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals  a young loren  handsome della marra  and a slinky ms  maxwell who make the story much more believable  giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be  altogether  an enchanting introduction to one of verdis great works  i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera  a form with which i was then not well acquainted  i still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals  luciano della marra was a standout as radames  and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films 
"I have to say I totally loved the movie. It had it's funny moments, some heartwarming parts, just all around good. Me, personally, really liked the movie because it's something that finally i can relate to my childhood. This movie, in my opinion, is geared more towards the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up. All the taunting, name-calling, and not knowing is something I, like most other young feminine boys, will always remember, and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay. So, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. Probably shouldn't really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it",1,i have to say i totally loved the movie  it had its funny moments  some heartwarming parts  just all around good  me  personally  really liked the movie because its something that finally i can relate to my childhood  this movie  in my opinion  is geared more towards the young gay population  it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up  all the taunting  name calling  and not knowing is something i  like most other young feminine boys  will always remember  and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay  so  i would definitely recommend seeing this movie  probably shouldnt really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
"""Going Berserk"" is actually one of the funniest Candy films I have ever seen, period. Sure, it's kinda low budget, but it's a non-stop comedic tour de force. There are tons of memorable quotes. For instance, when his soon-to-be father-in-law asks him how much he earns, Candy says ""Oh, I pull down anywhere between thirty and...eleven thousand dollars a year, sir."" Oh course, it is Candy's delivery that sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker. A clip of his horrible low budget movie ""Kung Fu U"" will have you rolling.<br /><br />So if you are a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can't recommend this movie enough.",1, going berserk  is actually one of the funniest candy films i have ever seen  period  sure  its kinda low budget  but its a non stop comedic tour de force  there are tons of memorable quotes  for instance  when his soon to be father in law asks him how much he earns  candy says  oh  i pull down anywhere between thirty and   eleven thousand dollars a year  sir   oh course  it is candys delivery that sells it  just classic stuff  eugene levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker  a clip of his horrible low budget movie  kung fu u  will have you rolling  so if you are a candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem  i cant recommend this movie enough 
"Okay. This has been a favourite since I was 14. Granted, I don't watch it multiple times a year anymore, but...

"""Absolute Beginners"" was a film for the younger generation, a multi-time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in Britain and how these troubled, constantly hitting each note, teen's problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow. It could have been dubbed the ""Moulin Rouge"" of the 80s, but it disappeared. It made its very shallow mark on the world, snuck under the radar, and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section, the comedy section, or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn't need chain money to survive. Alas, that wasn't where I found it  but I found it, watched it, tried my hardest to sing along with it, stared into Bowie's eyes, but found myself faded by the end. Did it not survive the test of time? Is 1950s London too far removed from our current society? Is Bowie too creepy? I think ""Absolute Beginners"" falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang, but withers to a mere sparkle by the end.<br /><br />""Absolute Beginners"" opens with a huge number that takes us through the non-gritty streets of London which involve theft nightly, prostitutes on every corner, dance throughout, booze like rivers, and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual. Sounds like a place we would all hate to be  right? Director Julien Temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters. The one we follow most is Colin played by Eddie O'Connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl, Suzette (played by Patsy Kensit). These two have chemistry, and while Suzette looks like a pre-rehab Lohan, to me they worked. There was a huge spark between them, the chemistry was like lava, and I believed that these two could take me down a road I had never traveled. I was ready  but then, something happened. Temple takes us out of the nightlife, takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning, and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first. Suzette runs away, Colin becomes a pervert, and Bowie  well  I am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain  I can tell you that much. Temple gives us this flashy city, this opportunity to see those that inhabit it, but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger. We learn about Colin, mainly, but nobody else. I could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom, and what importance fashion had to that era. Also, were they teens really  they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s, but maybe it was my TV.<br /><br />Character development thrown right out the door, Temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger, more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about. One of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example. Temple uses a split house to show us the lives of Colin's parents (of which I didn't know it was them until after the film) and a song which screams apathy. Great song, too many characters, not enough time, suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency, and it just falls apart in your hands. Then, if that wasn't enough, we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs, rubbing our noggin' trying to understand where our characters are or are going, and Temple throws in hatred, anger, and politics into the final act. While I was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme, I didn't think racism would be on the top of the bill. Suddenly, friends are missing, people are angry, and there is some random guy running around fighting Colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race? Somebody help me out here. It seemed completely rushed and overwhelming  nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off. To me, the ending of ""Absolute Beginners"" was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number. That first part set the pace, and Temple could not keep up.<br /><br />Overall, I must say that Temple can direct a music video, but I don't think he was quite prepared for the feature film. I don't think this film will ever make it into full ""cult"" status, and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come. It is a fun film to watch initially, but when we get to that final part, it just explodes from the inside. I wanted some cutting edge work, but instead what I found was a freaky Bowie coupled with characters I cared nothing for. I could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s, but by the end it just felt forced. I think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to ""Motivation"" by the ever-freaky Bowie in this film, it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status. I am glad that I watched this film once, but that is all that my small brain can take. I loved the way that Temple caught me from the beginning, but he couldn't control his characters (way too many), and the songs didn't seem to match the final moments of the film. It came out of nowhere, and it was unwelcomed. If this was a film about racism, it needed to be from the beginning. ""Absolute Beginners"" was a welcomed adventure, but I don't think I will be dusting this film off in the future.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****",0, absolute beginners  was a film for the younger

"Lucky me! I got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot-in-Texas 'horror' flick from Artisan Entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you...I've rarely laughed so hard in my life as I did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of 'worst killer clown movie ever made' from the insufferably stupid Full Moon fiasco KILLJOY (I'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one!) From all indications, it was shot on DV, and it doesn't really 'look' all that bad quality-wise for digital, but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts!<br /><br />The story (slight and cliche as it is) goes as follows... An executive (Ken Hebert, who also scripted and co-produced with the director) takes skeptical co-worker Tracy (Amanda Watson) and horny married couple Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) along on a weekend getaway to a (yawn) secluded cabin `12 miles' from the nearest town. On the way there, they pick up a bitchy/slutty hitchhiker (Melissa Bale) in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity-yackin, pot-smokin friends' disappears one-by-one, with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates.<br /><br />The killer clown doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box (aside from being morbidly obese). It basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods, chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes. I cannot say enough bad things about the cast, especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick, who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times. Doesn't really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense, originality, intelligence, general coherence or humor. I could go on for days on how inept this film is, how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is, but I'll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that Boy-This-Sucks kind of way.<br /><br />Also noting that the film has been released here in the US as S.I.C.K. (SERIAL INSANE CLOWN KILLER). It's currently catalogued under its (original title) of GRIM WEEKEND.<br /><br />Score: 1 out of 10",0,lucky me  i got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot in texas horror flick from artisan entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you   ive rarely laughed so hard in my life as i did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of worst killer clown movie ever made from the insufferably stupid full moon fiasco killjoy  im sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one   from all indications  it was shot on dv  and it doesnt really look all that bad quality wise for digital  but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts  the story  slight and cliche as it is  goes as follows    an executive  ken hebert  who also scripted and co produced with the director  takes skeptical co worker tracy  amanda watson  and horny married couple mark and susan  hank fields and chris buck  along on a weekend getaway to a  yawn  secluded cabin  12 miles from the nearest town  on the way there  they pick up a bitchy slutty hitchhiker  melissa bale  in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity yackin  pot smokin friends disappears one by one  with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates  the killer clown doesnt even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box  aside from being morbidly obese   it basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods  chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes  i cannot say enough bad things about the cast  especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick  who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times  doesnt really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense  originality  intelligence  general coherence or humor  i could go on for days on how inept this film is  how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is  but ill just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that boy this sucks kind of way  also noting that the film has been released here in the us as s i c k   serial insane clown killer   its currently catalogued under its  original title  of grim weekend  score  1 out of 10
"this could be one of the worse movies i've ever seen. i don't see how could this ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? its more like a lumbering drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT but since there weren't any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs. the movie had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them. they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant. this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different.",0,this could be one of the worse movies ive ever seen  i dont see how could this ever be described as a horror movie  or even a thriller  its more like a lumbering drama  the scary music is excellent but since there werent any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs  the movie had so much potential  they had beautiful cinematography  sp   and interesting characters  but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them  they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant  this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different 
"Before there was Crash, there was this interesting film called Grand Canyon. Released about 14 years sooner than the former film, Grand Canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime. To me Crash was still a slightly better film, but Grand Canyon was no slouch either.<br /><br />Taking place in Los Angeles, an upper-class lawyer named Mack (Kevin Kline) takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time. He calls for a tow truck, and has to wait for awhile, only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car. Soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment, and out steps Simon (Danny Glover) to take the truck away. Both men are threatened, but Simon manages to get himself, Mack, and the car out of dire straits. It is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with Mack helping out Simon just as Simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier. You see Simon's sister Deborah (Tina Lifford) is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children, and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people. Mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking Simon up with his secretary's friend Jane (Alfre Woodard).<br /><br />This is the main plot of the film, but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above (Mary Louise Parker) as well as Mack's wife, (Mary McDonnel) who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son Roberto (Jeremy Sisto in his first movie role) has gone to camp for the summer, and will likely be moving on with his own life soon. The details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes. This simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story.<br /><br />The director Lawrence Kasdan, whose biggest movie to this date was The Big Chill, has created a splendid movie here. The cast is excellent, and most of the ideas are well thought out, but alas it falls short of greatness because some points, that would've made the film even stronger, are glossed over. The story involving the secretary is one, and the second involving Simon's nephew is the other. These scenes should've been more apart of the entire story, and then maybe Lawrence Kasdan's views of life between the upper and lower classes would've been more on a superior level instead of just very good. Still Grand Canyon exceeded expectations, and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after. There is also a small role for Steve Martin as Davis, a producer of violent films, who offers his own views on life, and has a small part to play in this movie's ideas.",1,before there was crash  there was this interesting film called grand canyon  released about 14 years sooner than the former film  grand canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime  to me crash was still a slightly better film  but grand canyon was no slouch either  taking place in los angeles  an upper class lawyer named mack  kevin kline  takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time  he calls for a tow truck  and has to wait for awhile  only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car  soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment  and out steps simon  danny glover  to take the truck away  both men are threatened  but simon manages to get himself  mack  and the car out of dire straits  it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier  you see simons sister deborah  tina lifford  is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children  and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people  mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking simon up with his secretarys friend jane  alfre woodard   this is the main plot of the film  but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above  mary louise parker  as well as macks wife   mary mcdonnel  who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son roberto  jeremy sisto in his first movie role  has gone to camp for the summer  and will likely be moving on with his own life soon  the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes  this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story  the director lawrence kasdan  whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill  has created a splendid movie here  the cast is excellent  and most of the ideas are well thought out  but alas it falls short of greatness because some points  that wouldve made the film even stronger  are glossed over  the story involving the secretary is one  and the second involving simons nephew is the other  these scenes shouldve been more apart of the entire story  and then maybe lawrence kasdans views of life between the upper and lower classes wouldve been more on a superior level instead of just very good  still grand canyon exceeded expectations  and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after  there is also a small role for steve martin as davis  a producer of violent films  who offers his own views on life  and has a small part to play in this movies ideas 
"Scary Movie 3 is such a stinkfest its hard to put it in words. It makes movies like Malibu's Most Wanted look like Oscar material, lets just say that.<br /><br />The original Scary Movie was great fun, one of the better 90s spoof movies, coming from a great team who previously rocked our world with Dont Be A Menace to South Central Whilst Drinking Your Juice in the Hood. But what the hell happened?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, i thought the cast and crew change would help matters, but its even worse.<br /><br />Within 20mins i'd smiled twice. Not one laugh, the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor. The fact that at this point in writing, the majority of people on this site have voted it 10/10 has made me feel physically ill. When there's great flicks like School of Rock out, which actually have jokes that are *gasp* funny, anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined.<br /><br />no stars/****",0,scary movie 3 is such a stinkfest its hard to put it in words  it makes movies like malibus most wanted look like oscar material  lets just say that  the original scary movie was great fun  one of the better 90s spoof movies  coming from a great team who previously rocked our world with dont be a menace to south central whilst drinking your juice in the hood  but what the hell happened   after the tragedy that was scary movie 2  i thought the cast and crew change would help matters  but its even worse  within 20mins id smiled twice  not one laugh  the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor  the fact that at this point in writing  the majority of people on this site have voted it 10 10 has made me feel physically ill  when theres great flicks like school of rock out  which actually have jokes that are  gasp  funny  anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined  no stars     
"The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a ""walker"" is or will really care. I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70's. The subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in DC. I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end. Most didn't stay for the Q&A either.<br /><br />I don't think Schrader really thought the film out ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on. I really didn't get Woody's (Carter) private life or boyfriend either. What were all the ""artistic"" male bondage and torture pictures (from Iraq prisons) about? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for Woody's character (Car). It didn't work. It didn't even seem to make sense really.<br /><br />The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) flawlessly. You really did get a great sense of what a ""walker"" may have been like (say twenty years ago). He was great and most likely will never get recognized for it. <br /><br />As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin... Boring.<br /><br />Don't see it! It is painful! Unless you are a true Harrelson fan.",0,the film is bad  there is no other way to say it  the story is weak and outdated  especially for this country  i dont think most people know what a  walker  is or will really care  i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70s  the subject was just not believable for the year 2007  even being set in dc  i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end  most didnt stay for the q a either  i dont think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time  many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didnt know how to finish them  he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on  i really didnt get woodys  carter  private life or boyfriend either  what were all the  artistic  male bondage and torture pictures  from iraq prisons  about  what was he thinking  i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woodys character  car   it didnt work  it didnt even seem to make sense really  the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson  he played his character  car  flawlessly  you really did get a great sense of what a  walker  may have been like  say twenty years ago   he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it   as for lauren  lily and kristin    boring  dont see it  it is painful  unless you are a true harrelson fan 
"Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns. He was a great actor, From Here to Eternity and The Man with The Golden arm are a proof of that, but he did not have the physique of a western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, specially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie. In a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern, to break away from it the film has to be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow Sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. Also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible, why all the gunfighters have not adopted it? I think that this film should not have been withdrawn, because any film with Sinatra is worth seeing, and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable",0,frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns  he was a great actor  from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that  but he did not have the physique of a western hero  you identified him as an urban guy  but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho  the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault  i blame it on two factors  a  the story was too unusual  specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie  in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern  to break away from it the film has to be very good  b  the story is not convincing  it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother  also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible  why all the gunfighters have not adopted it  i think that this film should not have been withdrawn  because any film with sinatra is worth seeing  and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
"This film has the kernel of a really good story. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. This film mucks up a good story with three endings (none satisfying), a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged ""romantic"" relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire. The rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand acting (watch for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film. It could have been an excellent film - and Costner needs one!",0,this film has the kernel of a really good story  the work of the men and women of the coast guard  especially in the north pacific  is the stuff of heroes and legends  this film mucks up a good story with three endings  none satisfying   a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged  romantic  relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire  the rescue scenes are great   even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal   but the backstory is lame and disappointing  costner is good   especially his hand acting  watch for it   ashton kutcher is flat but not terrible  the main female characters are one dimensional  the best female is one of the coast guard sailors in the rescue center and shes on camera for about two minutes in the whole film  it could have been an excellent film   and costner needs one

"On the day of the California Presidential Primary, between midnight and 1:00 AM, the spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to USA. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, the Federal Agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family and is having trouble at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who blames her mother Teri for putting Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim, and they discover that the girl has run away home. While trying to solve his domestic problem, Jack is called to his Counter Terrorist Unit by his colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with their chief Richard Walsh, who discloses a menace against the life of Senator David Palmer, who is running for president, and they need to find the shooter. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and tells that there is a conspiracy in the agency against David Palmer, and assigns Jack to find the conspirators. When an airplane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has one additional issue to worry about.<br /><br />The first episode of ""24"" is a promising beginning of a successful series, introducing Jack Bauer. This is the first time that I have watched this show and I confess that I liked what I have seen: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a reliable agent in charge of three difficult missions at the same time: find a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agency; and find his teenage daughter, who is getting in trouble, while trying to save his marriage.

"Where to start... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (mind you that was the price I paid, got it from Wal-Mart), this movie was meant to be a thriller. The only THRILL I got was watching Kirkland's lousy rendition of Anne Wilkes from Misery sans snowy woodland area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least half way decent, then don't even bother.<br /><br />I for one enjoy crappy films, the worse the better in most cases. But Wow... I Meant WOW!! The only person in the entire film that didn't stink it up was the little boy, played by Vincent Berry.

"The characters were alive and interesting, the plot was excellently paced, the pyro effects were masterfully accomplished, and it takes a basic love triangle story and tosses in a science-fiction element into it.

That seems impossible to say the least. The fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though.

"Watching That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for Marlene Dietrich to do. Someone over at 20th Century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better.<br /><br />Betty plays a 19th century Italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree, sees no small resemblance in Doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed.<br /><br />Besides that the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment, before things have been consummated. That's going to give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee.<br /><br />Fresh, wholesome all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might have put this over, but with Betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can watch in anything.<br /><br />Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine's one chance for Oscar glory fell to Buttons And Bows.<br /><br />Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine.

"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of ""Basic Instinct"" and some maybe of ""Showgirls"". But Verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies: ""De Vierde Man"". This film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible, which makes the whole experience even more intense. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are exceptional, and Verhoeven's direction does the rest. ""De Vierde Man"" makes even ""Basic Instinct"" look quite tame...

"I really thought this wasn't that bad. Not a great work of art but Dermot M was the stronger performer by far. Patricia Arquette was overacting much of the time. He was actually playing cello which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. Besides, he is an incredibly Beautiful Man. Really sexy. Add that to the talent, and most anything he's been in is a lot more tolerable. He always gives his all even if some of the projects he's been involved in didn't quite hit the highest mark.. Not the fault of the actor in most cases. He's unfortunately been in some strange films that just didn't resonate at the box office. Always with A-list actors but just not always a ""hit"".

"I show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless: Why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed. Why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy. This is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of Steven Biko and the journalism of Donald Woods.

"In Frank Sinatra's first three films, he was purely a speciality act: ostensibly playing himself, he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie. In his fourth film, the very enjoyable 'Higher and Higher', Young Blue Eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role ... a task made easier because he's playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers.<br /><br />Sinatra's entrance is quite funny. Michele Morgan hears a knock at the door, and asks who's there. From outside, a Hoboken-toned voice answers 'Frank Sinatra'. Sure enough...<br /><br />The opening credits of 'Higher and Higher' may confuse some viewers, as the names of songwriters Rodgers and Hart are prominently displayed. In fact, they only contributed one song to this musical: 'Disgustingly Rich', which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song, 'I'm a Debutante'. Interestingly, that Rodgers & Hart song -- one of their weakest -- is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie's score; several others are lively up-tempo numbers, notably 'It's a Most Important Affair', 'When It Comes to Love, You're On Your Own' and 'I Saw You First'.<br /><br />Sinatra's good in this movie, but he would do better work (and sing better material) elsewhere. The real merits of 'Higher and Higher' are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films. Paul and Grace Hartman were an extremely popular husband-wife dance team who starred in several Broadway revues: genuinely graceful ballroom dancers, they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material. (Here, Grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of Paul's hands.) Grace Hartman, who died of cancer at age 48, did almost no film work, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up, to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform. After Grace Hartman's death, her husband had a long career as a character actor, just occasionally dancing solo. (Or alongside Ken Berry in one memorable episode of 'Mayberry RFD'.)<br /><br />Also quite attractive in a maid's uniform here in 'Higher and Higher' is the vivacious teenage singer Marcy McGuire. Why didn't this talented girl make more movies? Perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to Betty Hutton. I enjoy Hutton's performances but I like Marcy McGuire even better. Near the end of 'Higher and Higher' there's an amusing bit of physical business featuring McGuire and Mary Wickes as waitresses, taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub. The alternating strides of short McGuire and tall gawky Wickes are hilarious! Regrettably, although Leon Errol plays a large role in 'Higher and Higher', he is given almost no comedy business: not once does he do his famous rubber-legged dance. Jack Haley, despite his prominent billing, is also wasted.<br /><br />Very well-represented here is Dooley Wilson, inevitably remembered as Sam from 'Casablanca'. In that film, Wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of 'As Time Goes By'. (In real life, Wilson couldn't play piano.) Here in 'Higher and Higher', he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players. Less enjoyable is Mel Odious, I mean Mel Torme.

"Just a dumb old movie. First Stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way, and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck gets unlucky, yet again, and comes across an escaped convict. She has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way. In the end her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is. All's well than ends dumb.<br /><br />I could never figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in Hollywood's glamour-oriented Golden Era; that nose is so beautiful So photogenic The film is mercifully short, running a little over an hour. It's as though the director sensed that he was making crap, so he thought it best to keep the crap short.",0,just a dumb old movie  first stanwycks son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way  and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way  in an effort to save him  stanwyck gets unlucky  yet again  and comes across an escaped convict  she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way  in the end her husband is saved  and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is  alls well than ends dumb  i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywoods glamour oriented golden era  that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short  running a little over an hour  its as though the director sensed that he was making crap  so he thought it best to keep the crap short 
"...however I am not one of them. Caro Diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self-indulgent mess. Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but doesn't want to, whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it, but really doesn't want to either. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not that film. At one point, Moretti and his friends are standing outside the Communist Party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside, but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them. Interposed with Moretti's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant Pietro (the film drags us through several years and more than one election period). We keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument, but they never come. I for one doubt that I could have the patience to ever sit through a Nanni Moretti movie again.

"I was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates. But living in Italy titles like this never ever come across and I love step so much that I decided to give it try. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance-movie I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just ""winning"". It's touching and well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, she's so mature and focused and AWARE of her TALENT (and what talent Rutina Wesley has, my jaw dropped in the final dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is, honestly, inspiring. Also, the fact that she's not the typical super-hot chick (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana...) makes her really appealing and real. Seriously, why is this movie rated so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good work. Really good actually. I even cried at the end of the movie.

"Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon,when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun. I mean,the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness! It was the first movie I watched with this theme(drugs/marijuana) that is not really criticizing it,only making jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow,who lives in a small town in U.K. and has many financial problems because of her dead husband, who committed suicide since he was full of debts. The problem is that Grace, who imagined to have some money saved for her, discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things, specially her house that she loves so much. She never worked before, and is in a tragic situation until Matthew,her gardener who is very found of smoking pot, decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale.",1,saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun  i mean the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness  it was the first movie i watched with this theme drugs marijuana  that is not really criticizing it only making jokes about it  grace trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in u k  and has many financial problems because of her dead husband  who committed suicide since he was full of debts  the problem is that grace  who imagined to have some money saved for her  discovers that she needs to pay all of her husbands pounds in debts to not lose all of her things  specially her house that she loves so much  she never worked before  and is in a tragic situation until matthew her gardener who is very found of smoking pot  decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale 
"This movie in away was super-clever. It's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. Valentine makes ZERO attempt to be original. What is valentine anyway? It's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /><br />I only saw it once, and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody.<br /><br />I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came.<br /><br />Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How come every horror movie has to have a ""suprise"" killer, people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene. One minute a nice girl turns into an evil B--ch, then she's an insecure woman, and so on and son on.<br /><br />Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again Valentine doesn't have this. It was as if they tried to make it PG-13 but failed, so they left the edit. <br /><br />Do not see this overly-inspired, rip-off unless you hate yourself, and you want to die.<br /><br />*1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins-",0,this movie in away was super clever  its theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made  valentine makes zero attempt to be original  what is valentine anyway  its a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier  there is nothing original in valentine   i only saw it once  and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off  1 prom night 2 carrie 3 scream 4 any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody  i know there is more  but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldnt grab them as fast as they came  valentine had no chance of being a good movie  how come every horror movie has to have a  suprise  killer  people you dont care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene  one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b  ch  then shes an insecure woman  and so on and son on  normally any horror movie  in my book  can be saved by gore  once again valentine doesnt have this  it was as if they tried to make it pg 13 but failed  so they left the edit   do not see this overly inspired  rip off unless you hate yourself  and you want to die   1 2  3   j leonard rollins 
"I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, in comparison with Robert Altman's ingenious, hilarious, zany, and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic, this show was probably destined to be less-than-mediocre... even if it did run for 11 years, that doesn't necessarily make it any good. This show formed an all-too-integral part of my early childhood (it was on re-runs every night, and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up), but it's one of the memories I don't miss. And now that I actually have seen the movie, I can give this series an accurate critique. On its own, it's not nearly ""2 out of 10"" bad. However, the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie. Some of them technically are the same, but they're only similar in name. For instance, since when is Alan Alda anything like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as are his characterization and outlook. The new characters are not that great; they just serve to make you miss the ones that they're replacing. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually transfers to the series is Radar, who's still (even though played by the same actor) merely a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh, yeah. With a laugh track (it didn't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not), it comes across as creepy, due to what's going on in the other settings. And because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual Korean War, it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that doesn't work outside the world of cartoons.

"Well, I get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don't reflect my experience at all. To me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies. He was a die-hard villain, a no-apologies villain. To me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn't sort of undercut in some way.<br /><br />The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast. There I think maybe the director could have done better. But, to be honest, the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered. But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra Sahi's wife. She may be given little to do, but she does everything with total conviction. I'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience.<br /><br />So if you are in a habit for settling for Bollywood average, you won't get much out of this movie. But if you constantly search for something more, then this might give you some of what you've been missing.",1,well  i get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that dont reflect my experience at all  to me  amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies  he was a die hard villain  a no apologies villain  to me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isnt sort of undercut in some way  the kid who played aryan was probably over his head with this cast  there i think maybe the director could have done better  but  to be honest  the very best part of this movie was shernaz patel  she is an unsung heroine  a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered  but i must say i appreciated her contribution greatly as she played virendra sahis wife  she may be given little to do  but she does everything with total conviction  im sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience  so if you are in a habit for settling for bollywood average  you wont get much out of this movie  but if you constantly search for something more  then this might give you some of what youve been missing 
"(No need to recap the plot, since others have done so already.)<br /><br />It's understandable that many viewers find fault with the film, raised as we are with the slam-bang sensurround of today's cineplex experience. Against that background, a movie like Ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet. I think there are several worthwhile reasons why.<br /><br />Most importantly, the film unfolds poetically, as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold. Together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today's technology-driven cinema, where rapid-fire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it. Additionally, the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear, with almost no dialogue to explain what's happening. This amounts to another extreme departure from today's very literal fare, where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience. But perhaps most unsettling-- the movie is sometimes eerily quiet, not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be. But in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to. Thus, the burden of the story is shared between the film-maker and the viewer. The former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative, while the latter must think about those visuals, since they're not going to be explained.<br /><br />None of this is intended to belittle today's film-making. It's simply to point out that a movie like Machaty's comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today. I don't claim either to be any better or worse. However, I do claim that Ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from today's movie-going experience, where such 'contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring. <br /><br />The film itself is no masterpiece, though at times it reaches artistic heights, as in the beautifully composed beer-garden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below. The slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature, and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed. These are the kind of scenes that don't overwhelm you, but instead-- given half-a chance-- accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spine-tingling variety of a ""Jaws"". <br /><br />On the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy-handed, as when Machaty piles on the imagery, particularly in the final, ode-to-labor sequence. It's hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence. Perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the love-lorn hero and people in general-- a theme then being promoted by the influential Soviet cinema. Still, its presence here is rather tediously over-done.<br /><br />Anyhow, I've got to admit that I tuned in initially to see the gorgeous Hedy LaMarr in the buff. But now I have to admit that in the process I also got a lot more than just a peek-a-boo romp in the woods.",1, no need to recap the plot  since others have done so already   its understandable that many viewers find fault with the film  raised as we are with the slam bang sensurround of todays cineplex experience  against that background  a movie like ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet  i think there are several worthwhile reasons why  most importantly  the film unfolds poetically  as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills  trees  clouds  etc   providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold  together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from todays technology driven cinema  where rapid fire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it  additionally  the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear  with almost no dialogue to explain whats happening  this amounts to another extreme departure from todays very literal fare  where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience  but perhaps most unsettling   the movie is sometimes eerily quiet  not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be  but in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to  thus  the burden of the story is shared between the film maker and the viewer  the former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative  while the latter must think about those visuals  since theyre not going to be explained  none of this is intended to belittle todays film making  its simply to point out that a movie like machatys comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today  i dont claim either to be any better or worse  however  i do claim that ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from todays movie going experience  where such contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring   the film itself is no masterpiece  though at times it reaches artistic heights  as in the beautifully composed beer garden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below  the slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life  nature  and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed  these are the kind of scenes that dont overwhelm you  but instead   given half a chance   accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spine tingling variety of a  jaws    on the other hand  the film is sometimes heavy handed  as when machaty piles on the imagery  particularly in the final  ode to labor sequence  its hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence  perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the love lorn hero and people in general   a theme then being promoted by the influential soviet cinema  still  its presence here is rather tediously over done  anyhow  ive got to admit that i tuned in initially to see the gorgeous hedy lamarr in the buff  but now i have to admit that in the process i also got a lot more than just a peek a boo romp in the woods 
"There's the danger with the critic/philosopher Slavoj Zizek with his film, directed by Sophie Fiennes, which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent, horror, sci-fi, surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr Freudian comparisons to overload. But in the Pervert's Guide to Cinema he also makes even the more far-reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis I've seen on a collective section of films. While it doesn't cover the expansive territory Scorsese's movie documentaries cover, the same attachments are there, and Zizek has a definite love for all of these ""perverse"" examples and films, primarily the work of Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin and Tarkovsky. Yet one shouldn't go into seeing this- if you can find it that is, I got to see it almost by luck- thinking Zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse, deranged manner. If anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the Marx brothers as representations of the Id, Super-Ego and Ego (Harpo's example is most dead-on for me).<br /><br />He's not just one to take on the classics though, he also considers the food for thought in The Matrix and Fight Club- in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former, and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one's own self as well as ones double in the latter. He even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in Revenge of the Sith when Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children's births happens elsewhere. The ideals of fatherhood, male sexuality, the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality (at which point Zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare's creation), and female subjectivity, are explored perhaps most dead-on with Vertigo. This too goes for a scene that Zizek deconstructs as if it's the Zapruder film, where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho-sexual stance in the 'don't you look at me' scene in Blue Velvet.<br /><br />Now it would be one thing if Zizek himself went about making these sincere, excited, and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as Scorsese does. But he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality, and how they overlap, intersect, become one and the same, or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters (i.e. Lost Highway) by putting himself IN the locations the films take place in. Funniest is first seeing him in the boat ""heading"" towards the same dock Tippi Hedren's boat heads to at the beginning of the Birds; equally funny is as he waters the Blue Velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of Frank Booth; only one, when he's in Solaris-like territory, does it seem a little cheesy. But Zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set-up, and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and Zizek's words come through.<br /><br />There were some films I of course would've expected, chiefly from Hitchcock and Lynch, but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things- the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the Pervert's Guide of Cinema (top two for me would be the Disney Pluto cartoon and the exposition on Chaplin's films, albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of 'voice'), and the ones that one hasn't seen yet (i.e. the ventriloquist horror film, Dr. Mabuse, Stalker, among a few others) that inspire immediate feelings of 'wow, I have to see that immediately, no questions asked.' Zizek is a powerful writer with his work, and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place, to be entertained, sure, but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there, as he put it, looking into a toilet. It's probably one of the greatest films about cinema, and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how Freud works its way into films regarding desire, the Id/Super-Ego/Ego, and of the supernatural in fantasy, that you may never see...unless distribution finally kicks in, if only on the smallest levels.",1,theres the danger with the critic philosopher slavoj zizek with his film  directed by sophie fiennes  which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent  horror  sci fi  surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr freudian comparisons to overload  but in the perverts guide to cinema he also makes even the more far reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis ive seen on a collective section of films  while it doesnt cover the expansive territory scorseses movie documentaries cover  the same attachments are there  and zizek has a definite love for all of these  perverse  examples and films  primarily the work of hitchcock  lynch  chaplin and tarkovsky  yet one shouldnt go into seeing this  if you can find it that is  i got to see it almost by luck  thinking zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse  deranged manner  if anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise  would one think of three of the marx brothers as representations of the id  super ego and ego  harpos example is most dead on for me   hes not just one to take on the classics though  he also considers the food for thought in the matrix and fight club  in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former  and in the attachment of violence in dealing with ones own self as well as ones double in the latter  he even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in revenge of the sith when anakin becomes darth vader  and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his childrens births happens elsewhere  the ideals of fatherhood  male sexuality  the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality  at which point zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmares creation   and female subjectivity  are explored perhaps most dead on with vertigo  this too goes for a scene that zizek deconstructs as if its the zapruder film  where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho sexual stance in the dont you look at me scene in blue velvet  now it would be one thing if zizek himself went about making these sincere  excited  and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice over as scorsese does  but he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality  and how they overlap  intersect  become one and the same  or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters  i e  lost highway  by putting himself in the locations the films take place in  funniest is first seeing him in the boat  heading  towards the same dock tippi hedrens boat heads to at the beginning of the birds  equally funny is as he waters the blue velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi faceted points of frank booth  only one  when hes in solaris like territory  does it seem a little cheesy  but zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set up  and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and zizeks words come through  there were some films i of course wouldve expected  chiefly from hitchcock and lynch  but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things  the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the perverts guide of cinema  top two for me would be the disney pluto cartoon and the exposition on chaplins films  albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of voice   and the ones that one hasnt seen yet  i e  the ventriloquist horror film  dr  mabuse  stalker  among a few others  that inspire immediate feelings of wow  i have to see that immediately  no questions asked  zizek is a powerful writer with his work  and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place  to be entertained  sure  but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there  as he put it  looking into a toilet  its probably one of the greatest films about cinema  and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how freud works its way into films regarding desire  the id super ego ego  and of the supernatural in fantasy  that you may never see   unless distribution finally kicks in  if only on the smallest levels

"Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly, despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility. She will do everything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And thus beneath the vicey exterior, she reveals a rather sweet value system. The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate, with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with 'and then I woke up'. It is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but don't let any of that put you off.",1,maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly  despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility  she will do everything to make her marriage work  including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation  and thus beneath the vicey exterior  she reveals a rather sweet value system  the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate  with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with and then i woke up  it is also book ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence ive ever seen  but dont let any of that put you off

"This movie has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness, but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is that of the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ-betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie. Judas' passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can sense the angst. Peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerfully portrayed as the Judas drama. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and provocative Christ, whether believable or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS, to use in study or discussion groups.",1,this movie has problems in its presentation  may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness  but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues  one of these is the nature and character of the relationship between jesus and judas  another is that of the historical nature of the bible and faith  and third  is the humanity of jesus  the tension of the christ betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie  judas passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of christ  when judas takes his own life  the viewer can sense the angst  peters denial and guilt  however moving  are not as powerfully portrayed as the judas drama  chris sarandon offers a novel and provocative christ  whether believable or not  i would like to find this movie on dvd or even vhs  to use in study or discussion groups 
"Like with any movie genre, there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies. If you asked me to name a good gangster movie, I'd have dozens to choose from. If you asked me to name a bad gangster movie, probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since I saw the film for the first and I promise you, the last time. That film is ""The General"", unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name. This is a very dry, very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story (it's more than easy to follow) but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.<br /><br />Like ""Goodfellas"" (1990) and ""American Gangster"" (2007)two superior mob movies""The General"" is based on real people and true events. The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult. Meanwhile, the police led by an inspector named Kenny (Jon Voight) try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict (or kill) him.<br /><br />Perhaps because it's a film in the same category as the marvelous ""Goodfellas"" (1990) and the first two ""Godfather"" films, I was expecting too much from ""The General."" But that may be going too easy on it. This would have been a bad film had I not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far-too-stretched running time of screaming bad scenes. Let's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented. For some reason, director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in black-and-white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full-fledged color film. Now I have nothing against b/w pictures, not even ones made in modern-day times. ""Schindler's List"" (1993) was more than ninety percent filmed in black-and-white and it's a masterpiece. ""The General"", made just five years after ""Schindler's List"" is not. The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video-game-like quality that I found simply annoying. The filmmakers were obviously going for a realist's documentary-like style, like ""Schindler's List"" did, but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time, too much like a classic-style motion picture. Performances in the film range from passable to poor. Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles, but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting. The sound design is also very primitive, probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime-noir appeal, but that also fails because again, it's made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.<br /><br />But the worst thing that occurs is that there's not onenot onecharacter in the film that I felt any emotions or opinions for. In fact, for every moment of every scene, the only thought going through my head was ""okayso what?"" Moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time-consuming here. I did not sympathize or hate the Brendan Gleeson character because the way the Cahill character is written is simply flat and dull. Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did. If a character is killed off (as they always are in gangster films), we feel nothing. No remorse, no relief, no surprise, nothing. We just say ""so what?"" And that's all I did during the entire running time of this very flimsy, very poorly-made crime film.",0,like with any movie genre  there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies  if you asked me to name a good gangster movie  id have dozens to choose from  if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie  probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you  the last time  that film is  the general   unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name  this is a very dry  very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story  its more than easy to follow  but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor  like  goodfellas   1990  and  american gangster   2007 two superior mob movies the general  is based on real people and true events  the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin cahill  brendan gleeson  who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult  meanwhile  the police led by an inspector named kenny  jon voight  try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict  or kill  him  perhaps because its a film in the same category as the marvelous  goodfellas   1990  and the first two  godfather  films  i was expecting too much from  the general   but that may be going too easy on it  this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far too stretched running time of screaming bad scenes  lets start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented  for some reason  director john boorman and cinematographer seamus deasy selected to film this movie in black and white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full fledged color film  now i have nothing against b w pictures  not even ones made in modern day times   schindlers list   1993  was more than ninety percent filmed in black and white and its a masterpiece   the general   made just five years after  schindlers list  is not  the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video game like quality that i found simply annoying  the filmmakers were obviously going for a realists documentary like style  like  schindlers list  did  but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time  too much like a classic style motion picture  performances in the film range from passable to poor  brendan gleeson and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles  but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting  the sound design is also very primitive  probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime noir appeal  but that also fails because again  its made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place  but the worst thing that occurs is that theres not onenot onecharacter in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for  in fact  for every moment of every scene  the only thought going through my head was  okayso what   moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time consuming here  i did not sympathize or hate the brendan gleeson character because the way the cahill character is written is simply flat and dull  gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin cahill obviously did  if a character is killed off  as they always are in gangster films   we feel nothing  no remorse  no relief  no surprise  nothing  we just say  so what   and thats all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy  very poorly made crime film 
"Body Slam (1987) is a flat out terrible movie. The low budget reeks, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and acting is lame. But if you're into old school wrestling (circa 1970's through the mid-80') then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie stinks on ice. I gave it a two because I felt like being generous. This turkey was ""directed"" by stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict).<br /><br />The synopsis of this ""movie"" is about a promoter who wants to combine ""hair rock"" and wrestling. But their are others that don't want him to succeed. There's more but I don't want to SPOIL it for you.

"I usually like comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I don't really get the point of ""Envy"". I mean, it has a dull content/topic, and it's not really funny.<br /><br />Although the acting is generally good, it's not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting. Stiller and Black don't show all their talent in this movie.<br /><br />So, if you're about to rent a comedy, I suggest you definitely don't go for this one.

"Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in his skilled hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a fairly original plot (man dumps superhero, superhero gets superpower-fueled revenge), and shape it into something enjoyable. ""Girlfriend"" is an exercise in pointlessness. The one-trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film can't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama. The result is a film the flip-flops between both, with neither aspect being very well done. Uma Thurman is tops, as usual, and Luke Wilson pulls off his role too, though his slacker antics quickly grow tired. What's even more maddening is that, in certain scenes (such as when a very turned on Uma knocks a headboard through a wall), you sense a witty, raucous Reitman opus practically screaming to get out. But seconds later, the magic is lost, gone as quick as the superheroine whose movies disappoints in almost every way.",0,ivan reitman is something of a savior  the most tired plots  ghostbusters  evolution  come to life in his skilled hands  even his occasional flop  six days  seven nights  show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing  so i was disappointed that reitman could not take a fairly original plot  man dumps superhero  superhero gets superpower fueled revenge   and shape it into something enjoyable   girlfriend  is an exercise in pointlessness  the one trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes  the film cant decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama  the result is a film the flip flops between both  with neither aspect being very well done  uma thurman is tops  as usual  and luke wilson pulls off his role too  though his slacker antics quickly grow tired  whats even more maddening is that  in certain scenes  such as when a very turned on uma knocks a headboard through a wall   you sense a witty  raucous reitman opus practically screaming to get out  but seconds later  the magic is lost  gone as quick as the superheroine whose movies disappoints in almost every way 
"My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, having read it to several of her classes. It never sounded all that interesting to me, though, and I bought the DVD figuring this would be a movie that wouldn't really be up my alley.<br /><br />The first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and I found myself thinking that I was right. It starts off a bit slow and I have to admit that I was a little bit bored - but curious enough to stay with it. Boy, am I glad I did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I would most certainly watch this again!<br /><br />The casting was very good. Since I haven't read the book, I can't vouch for accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was truly delightful. You liked the characters you were supposed to like, hated the ones you were supposed to hate, and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny.<br /><br />I can see how some folks might not like this movie. It is tedious at times, especially in the beginning. All the flashbacks can be distracting (though they are essential to the story). Once the story starts to come together at the end, though, I think you're paid back in spades for your patience. When all is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10.<br /><br />",1,my wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story  having read it to several of her classes  it never sounded all that interesting to me  though  and i bought the dvd figuring this would be a movie that wouldnt really be up my alley  the first half of the movie has a lot of set up and i found myself thinking that i was right  it starts off a bit slow and i have to admit that i was a little bit bored   but curious enough to stay with it  boy  am i glad i did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie  i would most certainly watch this again  the casting was very good  since i havent read the book  i cant vouch for accuracy  but i have to say that jon voight was truly delightful  you liked the characters you were supposed to like  hated the ones you were supposed to hate  and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny  i can see how some folks might not like this movie  it is tedious at times  especially in the beginning  all the flashbacks can be distracting  though they are essential to the story   once the story starts to come together at the end  though  i think youre paid back in spades for your patience  when all is said and done  i think this is a very good movie   8 10 
"This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film I've seen. I say pretty much, because I have also seen Soldier, in which he plays the villain... but from what I've heard, it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee film. This, however, is. And if this is any indication of the quality of such films, I won't be seeing any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist... as the lead, he's awful. He gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film, probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane, he barely seems like a villain at all. The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time... or maybe it's the other way around. I can't say for sure... and I definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure. The effects are not completely horrible... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, the film screws up that interesting idea as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pacing is poor. I can't think of one positive thing to say about this film... I really can't. It's simply too formulaic and pointless. If only I had a time-machine, so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made... no, never mind. I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to fans of Lee, and no one else.

"This is one irresistible great cheerful- and technically greatly made movie!<br /><br />The movie features some of the greatest looking sets you'll ever see in a '30's movie, even though it's all too obvious that they are sets, rather than real place locations. Often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive, the entire set would obviously move.<br /><br />The best moments of the movie were the silent, more old fashioned, slapstick kind of moments. It shows that René Clair's true heart was at silent movie-making. The overall humor is really great in this movie. Also of course the musical moments were more than great. This is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early French musical. Though the best moments are the silent moments, that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog, that gets very well delivered by the main actors, who all seemed like stage actors to me, which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no-worries atmosphere. No wonder this worked out so well, since this movie is actually based on stage play by Georges Berr.<br /><br />It's a technical really great movie, with also some great innovation camera-work in it and some really great editing, that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences. There is never a dull moment in this movie!<br /><br />René Clair was such a clever director, who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies. It's a very creative made movie, that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie, that never seizes to entertain.<br /><br />The last half hour is especially unforgettably fun, without spoiling too much, and is really among the greatest, as well as most creative moments in early comedy film-making.<br /><br />The movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters, who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks. It all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie.<br /><br />One of the most pleasant movies you'll ever see!<br /><br />8/10",1,this is one irresistible great cheerful  and technically greatly made movie  the movie features some of the greatest looking sets youll ever see in a 30s movie  even though its all too obvious that they are sets  rather than real place locations  often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive  the entire set would obviously move  the best moments of the movie were the silent  more old fashioned  slapstick kind of moments  it shows that rené clairs true heart was at silent movie making  the overall humor is really great in this movie  also of course the musical moments were more than great  this is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early french musical  though the best moments are the silent moments  that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog  that gets very well delivered by the main actors  who all seemed like stage actors to me  which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no worries atmosphere  no wonder this worked out so well  since this movie is actually based on stage play by georges berr  its a technical really great movie  with also some great innovation camera work in it and some really great editing  that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences  there is never a dull moment in this movie  rené clair was such a clever director  who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies  its a very creative made movie  that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie  that never seizes to entertain  the last half hour is especially unforgettably fun  without spoiling too much  and is really among the greatest  as well as most creative moments in early comedy film making  the movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters  who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks  it all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie  one of the most pleasant movies youll ever see  8 10
"After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism, nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth. The story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his ""unfinished"" pupil out to find the 5 past members of his Poison Clan, so they do not seek out a fortune which the master's friend keeps hidden. Afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training, he instructs him to befriend one of the five ""venoms"" so as to defeat the other four.<br /><br />I can't say enough about the choreography or the camera work. A fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made.

"Yeah, Madsen's character - whilst talking to the woman from the TV station - is right: the LAPD IS a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie changes nothing about it. Okay, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even a black one, whow, a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not like that. And most important for the action fans: The shoot out is boring. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, then you will at least have something to do. The only moral of this film is: The LAPD is good now. No more bad cops in it. If you like uncritical, euphemistic commercials for police and military service, watch this movie.

"Leslie Sands' stilted play ""Deadlock"" becomes a poor-choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, just after their joint-success in ""All About Eve"". After killing her spouse, a scheming woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors from her peak years, is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously aloof and restrained until the outrageous finale (where she thankfully pulls out all the stops).

"I think if you were to ask most JW's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find they do not. I know I do not. What you will find instead is that they believe the promises Christ made of a resurrection. So, even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah can, and will correct this.<br /><br />It really gets down to a simple question: is God real to you or is this all just make believe? If he is real, and you trust him, you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be.<br /><br />I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words ""NO BLOOD"" written in large letters over my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came? She didn't get it -- God just isn't real enough to her. Too bad.

"The first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen. It was a bad version of 'Back to the Future' with zero charm. Once accepted that Bill & Ted are nitwits, the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks.<br /><br />This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning...<br /><br />By today's standards, this is more fun. This was shunned upon release, sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time. We get the photographer of 'Face/Off', the editor of 'Fugitive', a production designer from Burton's early work, and the sound designer of 'Matrix'.<br /><br />The writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep. Since this was shunned by the fanbase and public, the director probably decided the style was too extreme. It's not, it fits the material. Like 'Death Becomes Her' and 'Catch-22', this dares to be smart, but we like our movies ""simple"" so we don't buy it. Probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off. What's so good?<br /><br />--Nice self-reference towards Keanu; from airhead to Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />--Joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts, he makes his own hatred. The Evil B&T and the ""good robot usses"" have the same vocabulary as their originals: lesser copies and depreciation of language.<br /><br />--The ""duality"" motif. Nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles, lots of high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith from 'Total Recall' to emphasize the point.<br /><br />--The ""choices"" motif. I don't know where this started in the genre (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but it's used pretty well here. It even boils down to the 7 games against death--Battleship and Club.<br /><br />--Film self-reference, even present in the game against Death (Clue). This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Notice the Premier magazine cover at the end: ""Bill and Ted: The Movie."" Ironic also how Death and Nomolos were villains in the 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon' sequels.<br /><br />I still have some minor nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former--particularly in the teen market. Carlin is a great comedian, but in these movies he's wasted. Also, for all the daring this effort shows, even cracking gay jokes, they can't kill a cat?<br /><br />So, despite looking like a Nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting. From this movie we got Beavis and Butt-Head.

"Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you could think. First of all the plot is idiotic, it has no sense at all. The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. Actors play so-so, with an exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like ""I want to *beep* you "" and it looks like, let's say it gently, a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all. That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD, but on a far lower lever than the original movie. For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: ""Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?"" All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema. It was provoking, sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stone's performance in her career. It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie, badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories.

"This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and dull.

Four hours of simply bashing on the Nazi's.... c'mon!

"The author of ""Nekromantik"", Jörg Buttgereit's second feature film, ""Der Todesking"" is a powerful masterpiece. Centered around a chain letter originating from a group called ""The Brotherhood of the 7th Day"", the movie shows 7 episodes, each consisting of one day during one week, where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it's rounds. Do not touch this one if you like Hollywood movies or musicals, enjoy happy or even remotely ""normal"" movies or expect a movie to be good only, if it is focused on stage acting.<br /><br />The nihilistic, avant-garde approach of Der Todesking well explains, why Buttgereit's movies in general were banned in Germany, their native country of origin, during the 80's and most of the 90's. Der Todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on-screen, but the meaningless apathy or depression most people's lives consist of in general. Buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living, only reasons to stop, and in choosing how and when you die, you can also be the king of death, Der Todesking.<br /><br />Buttgereit's movies are generally difficult to categorize and Der Todesking is no exception. Featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies, ""art film"" would probably be the closest description every time. Der Todesking features an original method to shoot, create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene. During one scene, the camera slowly, continuously pans in 360 degree circle, while a person lives in a small one-room apartment for a day. During another, Buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man, while he dwells in his desperation. During a third, seemingly pleasant scene names, ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on-screen, supposedly warranting the ban in Germany for this particular movie.<br /><br />Episode movies (and especially this one, as the scenes are only vaguely connected) generally suffer from incoherence, and Der Todesking is no exception. While all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it's consequences or subsequences in all it's variations, there are very powerful episodes, yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material, partly draining the overall power of the movie - still, the the jaw-dropping, immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from it's more vague moments back to the status of greatness. The general atmosphere is baffling, awe-inspiring, highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting - so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival I took part of.<br /><br />This is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come. Not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans, this is a small, different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience. Whether it be confusion, amazement or even hate, you aren't likely to be left cold by this, in my opinion the best, achievement of this small indie crew.<br /><br />The main theme of the movie, ""Die Fahrt ins Reich der Menschentrümmer part I-III"" was released in a limited 666-piece 8"" vinyl edition, which is now much sought after. You still can get the classical masterpiece by getting ""The Nekromantik"" soundtrack CD, which I highly recommend. The Lo-Fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky, almost illbient-like, makes an essential part of the movie's atmosphere, and is something you would very, very rarely hear otherwise. Much recommended!",1,the author of  nekromantik   jörg buttgereits second feature film   der todesking  is a powerful masterpiece  centered around a chain letter originating from a group called  the brotherhood of the 7th day   the movie shows 7 episodes  each consisting of one day during one week  where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making its rounds  do not touch this one if you like hollywood movies or musicals  enjoy happy or even remotely  normal  movies or expect a movie to be good only  if it is focused on stage acting  the nihilistic  avant garde approach of der todesking well explains  why buttgereits movies in general were banned in germany  their native country of origin  during the 80s and most of the 90s  der todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on screen  but the meaningless apathy or depression most peoples lives consist of in general  buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living  only reasons to stop  and in choosing how and when you die  you can also be the king of death  der todesking  buttgereits movies are generally difficult to categorize and der todesking is no exception  featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies   art film  would probably be the closest description every time  der todesking features an original method to shoot  create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene  during one scene  the camera slowly  continuously pans in 360 degree circle  while a person lives in a small one room apartment for a day  during another  buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man  while he dwells in his desperation  during a third  seemingly pleasant scene names  ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on screen  supposedly warranting the ban in germany for this particular movie  episode movies  and especially this one  as the scenes are only vaguely connected  generally suffer from incoherence  and der todesking is no exception  while all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and its consequences or subsequences in all its variations  there are very powerful episodes  yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material  partly draining the overall power of the movie   still  the the jaw dropping  immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from its more vague moments back to the status of greatness  the general atmosphere is baffling  awe inspiring  highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting   so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival i took part of  this is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come  not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans  this is a small  different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience  whether it be confusion  amazement or even hate  you arent likely to be left cold by this  in my opinion the best  achievement of this small indie crew  the main theme of the movie   die fahrt ins reich der menschentrümmer part i iii  was released in a limited 666 piece 8  vinyl edition  which is now much sought after  you still can get the classical masterpiece by getting  the nekromantik  soundtrack cd  which i highly recommend  the lo fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky  almost illbient like  makes an essential part of the movies atmosphere  and is something you would very  very rarely hear otherwise  much recommended 
"When I really began to be interested in movies, at the age of eleven, I had a big list of 'must see' films and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend; some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts. I remember one of the films on that list was ""A Chorus Line"" and could never get it; so now to see it is a dream come true.<br /><br />Of course, I lost the list and I would do anything to get it back because I think there were some really interesting things to watch there. I mean, take ""A Chorus Line"", a stage play turned into film. I know it's something we see a lot nowadays, but back then it was a little different, apparently; and this film has something special.<br /><br />Most of the musicals made movies today, take the chance the camera gives them for free, to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places; ""A Chorus Line"" was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie. Following a big audition held by recognized choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job.<br /><br />Everything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition between the dancersAnd it all occurs on the stage, where Douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they list shortens as the hours go by.<br /><br />Like a movie I saw recently, ""A Prairie Home Companion"", the broadcast of a radio show, Atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity. On or behind the stage, things are going on, and time doesn't seem to stop. Again, I don't if Atenborough cut a lot to shoot this, but it sure doesn't look like it; and anyway it's a great directing and editing (John Bloom) work. But in that little stage, what you wonder is what to do with the cameraWith only one setting, Ronnie Taylor's cinematography finds the way, making close-ups to certain characters, zooming in and out, showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of New York.<br /><br />In one crucial moment, Douglas tells the ones that are left: ""Before we start eliminating: you're all terrific and I'd like to hire you all; but I can't"". This made me think about reality shows today, where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving (even when they are not good). It's hard, you must imagine; at least here, where all of them really are terrific.<br /><br />To tell some of the stories, the characters use songs and, in one second, the stage takes a new life and it literally is 'a dream come true'. The music by Marvin Hamlisch and the lyrics by Edward Kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws, showing these dancers' feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett. The book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by Arnold Schulman; which is very touching at times. So if it's not with a song it will be with a word; but in ""A Chorus Line"", it's impossible not to be moved.<br /><br />During one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition, Cassie, a special dancer played by Alyson Reed, takes the stage to convince Douglas character that she can do it. The words ""let me dance for you"" never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics.",1,when i really began to be interested in movies  at the age of eleven  i had a big list of must see films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend  some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts  i remember one of the films on that list was  a chorus line  and could never get it  so now to see it is a dream come true  of course  i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there  i mean  take  a chorus line   a stage play turned into film  i know its something we see a lot nowadays  but back then it was a little different  apparently  and this film has something special  most of the musicals made movies today  take the chance the camera gives them for free  to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places   a chorus line  was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie  following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach  michael douglas   richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job  everything happens on the same day  the tension of not knowing  the stress of having to learn the numbers  the silent competition between the dancersand it all occurs on the stage  where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences  there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic  but they list shortens as the hours go by  like a movie i saw recently   a prairie home companion   the broadcast of a radio show  atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity  on or behind the stage  things are going on  and time doesnt seem to stop  again  i dont if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this  but it sure doesnt look like it  and anyway its a great directing and editing  john bloom  work  but in that little stage  what you wonder is what to do with the camerawith only one setting  ronnie taylors cinematography finds the way  making close ups to certain characters  zooming in and out  showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york  in one crucial moment  douglas tells the ones that are left   before we start eliminating  youre all terrific and id like to hire you all  but i cant   this made me think about reality shows today  where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving  even when they are not good   its hard  you must imagine  at least here  where all of them really are terrific  to tell some of the stories  the characters use songs and  in one second  the stage takes a new life and it literally is a dream come true  the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws  showing these dancers feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett  the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman  which is very touching at times  so if its not with a song it will be with a word  but in  a chorus line   its impossible not to be moved  during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition  cassie  a special dancer played by alyson reed  takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it  the words  let me dance for you  never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics 
"I have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and I would first like to say that I understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well: viewed from an Israeli perspective, I can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie. What I would like to say is that 'Distortion' was shown at a film festival in Geneva in November 2005 (Festival 'Cinéma tout écran') where it won the award of the audience ('Prix du public'in French). For what affects me, I liked the 'nervous camera' work of Mr Bouzaglo, who, in my opinion, portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well, and I think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie. This perspective, however, might seem totally 'alien' to an Israeli viewer, but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers, because Switzerland is a country which has NEVER been subject to any terrorist attack. It therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in Geneva judged this film with a much more 'detached' perspective.I would also like to quote what Mr Bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a Geneva newspaper (I'm translating from French): ''After 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence, we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal.We might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living. We are like the characters in my movie,''on the edge of the edge''. This is the reason why the private detective, who is somehow ''voyeur'' is the happiest character in the movie, because he earns a living thanks to the system, he takes advantage of this situation'' This is, in substance, the main thing that I and the swiss public, in my opinion, pointed out in this movie, and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor. So, to sum up, different country=different perspective, but I think that this is somehow great, because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema, that is to say that it well never be subject to a 'unique' of 'formatted' way of thinking.",1,i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well  viewed from an israeli perspective  i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie  what i would like to say is that distortion was shown at a film festival in geneva in november 2005  festival cinéma tout écran  where it won the award of the audience  prix du publicin french   for what affects me  i liked the nervous camera work of mr bouzaglo  who  in my opinion  portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well  and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie  this perspective  however  might seem totally alien to an israeli viewer  but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers  because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack  it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more detached perspective i would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper  im translating from french   after 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence  we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living  we are like the characters in my movie on the edge of the edge  this is the reason why the private detective  who is somehow voyeur is the happiest character in the movie  because he earns a living thanks to the system  he takes advantage of this situation this is  in substance  the main thing that i and the swiss public  in my opinion  pointed out in this movie  and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor  so  to sum up  different country different perspective  but i think that this is somehow great  because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema  that is to say that it well never be subject to a unique of formatted way of thinking

"This is absurd - aside from the fellow Australian who has reviewed this flick, I can't help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they were with their praise.<br /><br />Admittedly I'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions so I didn't go in with many expectations, yet still I found Elektra to be incredibly underwhelming. The thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this film which went by unexplained, that left you thinking ""huh, what relevance does that have to the plot?"" or ""so how did that aspect of the character come about?"" I can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in Daredevil, which I have no intention of seeing.<br /><br />Furthermore, the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about-face at random moments to suit the storyline, and don't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub-plot. I'm also (still) scratching my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have gone by unexplained.<br /><br />If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot, but otherwise I gained little enjoyment from Elektra. I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy/action films, but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing (even by action film standards) that it simply frustrated me.<br /><br />Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good.",0,this is absurd   aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick  i cant help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra  considering how generous they were with their praise  admittedly im not really a fan of comic book to movie conversions so i didnt go in with many expectations  yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming  the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained  that left you thinking  huh  what relevance does that have to the plot   or  so how did that aspect of the character come about   i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil  which i have no intention of seeing  furthermore  the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about face at random moments to suit the storyline  and dont even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub plot  im also  still  scratching my head over the fate of cary hiroyuki tagawas character  which seems to have gone by unexplained  if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot  but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra  i know were supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy action films  but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing  even by action film standards  that it simply frustrated me  well  hell  at least jennifer garner looks damn good 
"I can't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction. Forget the product placement disaster, the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plot-holes. This wasn't only laughable and but painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children.<br /><br />What a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after we've had Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (by the same director).

"This is a better than average silent movie and it's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents. However, if you aren't yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other films before watching this one. That's because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots. But, despite this, it's still a good film and kept my interest.<br /><br />A nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief. Despite this, she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life. However, the rent is due and there's no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal. Unfortunately, the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can't make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man's date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now--given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her?! Well, see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved. I DIDN'T like how they handled the husband, as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd. However, once he was out of the way, I do admire how the film also DIDN'T give up a by-the-numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends.<br /><br />All in all, a very good film worth seeing, but certainly not great.",1,this is a better than average silent movie and its still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents  however  if you arent yet a fan of the genre  i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one  thats because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots  but  despite this  its still a good film and kept my interest  a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him  the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief  despite this  she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life  however  the rent is due and theres no money  so the lady is forced to look for work  she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal  unfortunately  the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party cant make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the mans date  well  like cinderella  she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her  what to do now  given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her   well  see the movie yourself to see how its all resolved  i didnt like how they handled the husband  as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd  however  once he was out of the way  i do admire how the film also didnt give up a by the numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends  all in all  a very good film worth seeing  but certainly not great

The rest of the film, could have easily been made by middle school children. I give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated.

"Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor. The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence.<br /><br />The film alludes to incest--without a single explicit scene--but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary. Though this is not major film by any reckoning, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. <br /><br />Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a treat to watch, exuding tragedy silently.

"I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I am a film student at the Univeristy of Michigan so I know a thing or two about film. And Crispin Glover's film is outrageous. He basically exploits the mentally challenged. Not only is Shirly Temple the anti-Christ (which I admit is a little funny) telling the mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are, mentally challenged. PETA and Human Rights should be all over this thing.

"This is a more interesting than usual porn movie, because it is a fantasy adventure.The production values are high and the acting is(believe it or not) pretty good,especially Jenna Jameson.It`s also in widescreen which helps,it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and NOT a porn movie.But,of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes,fine atmosphere and scenery.And by the way,the sex IS hot.<br /><br />Watch out for this one...",1,this is a more interesting than usual porn movie  because it is a fantasy adventure the production values are high and the acting is believe it or not  pretty good especially jenna jameson it s also in widescreen which helps it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and not a porn movie but of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes fine atmosphere and scenery and by the way the sex is hot  watch out for this one   
"W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is supposed to be a English language classic. If so, much must have been missing from the film version here. Phillip's (Leslie Howard) attraction to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post-breakup retelling of a relationship from the man's point of view. Being a family lawyer I've heard many such accounts; the man depicts himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man.<br /><br />Indeed, unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even indulges Mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity, but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - enraged and now of dubious sanity - the free run of his flat, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period didn't occur here. In fact, by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later.<br /><br />I note how Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed. It tells me that Phillip craves middle class respectability. Someone like that could not run from a woman with a course Cockney accent fast enough. Phillip is, for most of the movie, a student; such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger, and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov, as it will. And balanced that by allowing Mildred a modicum of charm.",0,w  somerset maughams of human bondage is supposed to be a english language classic  if so  much must have been missing from the film version here  phillips  leslie howard  attraction to mildred  bette davis  is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post breakup retelling of a relationship from the mans point of view  being a family lawyer ive heard many such accounts  the man depicts himself as noble and always correct  and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man  indeed  unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker  this is an uncomfortable movie to watch  phillip even indulges mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity  but the real high point comes when phillip allows mildred   enraged and now of dubious sanity   the free run of his flat  with predictable results  bette davis was attractive for about five years of her life  but that period didnt occur here  in fact  by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the baby jane character she would play thirty years later  i note how howards character is always impeccably dressed and groomed  it tells me that phillip craves middle class respectability  someone like that could not run from a woman with a course cockney accent fast enough  phillip is  for most of the movie  a student  such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger  and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status   an english raskolnikov  as it will  and balanced that by allowing mildred a modicum of charm

"This is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn't appear literally until half way in. Nevertheless I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady. Curtis, though competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson, looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards (perhaps he should have shaved his moustache) and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe I found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex. He is no stock villain. Superb character actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again in top form as the 'little man with big ambitions.' His drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. This movie however is carried by the very capable and comely Ella Raines as the devoted would be lover of Henderson, Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of her work I have seen and I am definitely inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent. All in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to.

"I feel like I'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branagh's performance. He is a fine actor by most accounts, but he simply could not pull off the Southern accent. I mean, it was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous reviewers questioned why U.S. actors were not cast in this film. I second that notion. It's wonderful when actors/actresses wish to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained. Maybe it was Altman, but he's a such a great director...<br /><br />Well, I really don't want to bash Branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much. Everybody deserves to screw up here and there.

"I really, really didn't expect this type of a film outside of America. How anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a ""thriller"" is just sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously admired) going around like some sort of child-saving Rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world.<br /><br />What's doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground-breaking film ""Happiness"" came out the year BEFORE this film. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. They were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch ""Happiness"" to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia.<br /><br />Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm...I wonder. If they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button-pushing crap. 1/10",0,i really  really didnt expect this type of a film outside of america  how anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a  thriller  is just sick  auteuil  whom i had previously admired  going around like some sort of child saving rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world  whats doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground breaking film  happiness  came out the year before this film  menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves  its admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there  they were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic  those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch  happiness  to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia  do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor  teacher  friend or even a relative  hmm   i wonder  if they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button pushing crap  1 10

"This movie looked good - good cast, evergreen topic and an explosive opening. It went downhill from there. Why was it filmed by hand held camera? It shakes, judders, part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A poor choice indeed. As if this was not enough, the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer - mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all. And then it commits the worst sin of all. After leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they roll credits without revealing the denouement - the ending - the payoff -like what the heck was the motive? How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending? Doh! This movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Poor effort by writer and director.",0,this movie looked good   good cast  evergreen topic and an explosive opening  it went downhill from there  why was it filmed by hand held camera  it shakes  judders  part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer  a poor choice indeed  as if this was not enough  the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer   mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all  and then it commits the worst sin of all  after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion  they roll credits without revealing the denouement   the ending   the payoff  like what the heck was the motive  how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending  doh  this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud  what a waste of effort  poor effort by writer and director 
"All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten. Then they start rolling the title credits: You see ""Slugs!"" in big letters, followed shortly thereafter by ""The Movie."" WHEW! I was worried I had accidentally tuned into ""Slugs: The Musical"" or ""Slugs: The Game Show."" Anyway, from there the movie deteriorates into a kill-fest. You see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove, two people get attacked by slugs while having sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs. It's a pretty silly movie, falling in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category. It also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I'm VERY surprised it has received as high a score as it has here, because most people here don't give those types of movie any love. But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable, this is one of your prime candidates.",0,all you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene  where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten  then they start rolling the title credits  you see  slugs   in big letters  followed shortly thereafter by  the movie   whew  i was worried i had accidentally tuned into  slugs  the musical  or  slugs  the game show   anyway  from there the movie deteriorates into a kill fest  you see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove  two people get attacked by slugs while having sex  and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs  its a pretty silly movie  falling in the  so bad its good  category  it also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that youre shocked to learn it was made in 1988  my guess was 1974   im very surprised it has received as high a score as it has here  because most people here dont give those types of movie any love  but if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable  this is one of your prime candidates 
"I was especially delighted that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. The cast played very well, too, and I liked the script following Shakespeare's original text so faithfully. But I must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she is very modest, and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I liked the film and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.",1,i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark skinned and desdemona didnt have fair hair like almost always  the cast played very well  too  and i liked the script following shakespeares original text so faithfully  but i must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as desdemona  i have always thought she is very modest  and thats why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with cassio   although it was happening only in othellos imagination  at first  i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and desdemona was shown so openly  but as a whole  i liked the film and especially desdemona crying in the dying scene 
"This was the best Muppet movie I've seen ever! I happen to know that Miss Piggy's fantasy of meeting as infants was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will remain in my head forever. Only saying so because that stupid Nickelodeon show Hey Dude song still remains in my head. Sorry, a little off the topic there. But anyway what I like is Animal after the credits saying ""Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Hasta Luego!"" That made me laugh so hard. My absolute favorite is the play at the end. I was surprised that the Sesame Street characters popped in at the wedding. I'm just glad this movie was very entertaining. I borrowed it from the library, and now I have bought it because I can't keep the library's copy forever.

"A lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates a suspenseful, Gothic atmosphere but the script is weak. Sporting a Southern drawl, Branagh is convincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire. Downey is likable as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but Altman is always worth a look.",1,a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a grisham novel  altman creates a suspenseful  gothic atmosphere but the script is weak  sporting a southern drawl  branagh is convincing as the lawyer  and davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire  downey is likable as a private detective  duvall has a small role  which does not allow him to do much with his weird character  hannah and berenger round out the impressive cast  after an interesting setup  the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise  but altman is always worth a look 
"The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote, poised to flick around to watch something else. The premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a self-storage-space ""bin"" was mildly amusing, but, painfully bland.<br /><br />The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - the big deal movie guy, that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes. And then a few more until Kristy Swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac, added a bit of spice. Her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.<br /><br />Ultimately, the obvious low-budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. Some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget, Whithnail & I being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck.<br /><br />However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the ""Terrible movie"" archives and just about nudges it into the ""could have been a cult movie"" archives. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantoliano's character. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichéd, but still funny, rich-but-screwed-up characters house, where the story unravels towards it's final moments.<br /><br />I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film-makers did their best to translate this to celluloid, it simply didn't work and while I laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners, I think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree I would have laughed at anything.<br /><br />Unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket.",0,the first 30 minutes of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote  poised to flick around to watch something else  the premise of two writers  down on their luck  living in a self storage space  bin  was mildly amusing  but  painfully bland  the introduction of the character  played by joe pantoliano   the big deal movie guy  that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory  offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes  and then a few more until kristy swansons introduction as a budding film director   borderline nymphomaniac  added a bit of spice  her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye candy inclusion  ultimately  the obvious low budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes  stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments  some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget  whithnail   i being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream  but down on their luck  however  for my money  the actors save tinseltown from the  terrible movie  archives and just about nudges it into the  could have been a cult movie  archives  i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe pantolianos character  in particular  the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichéd  but still funny  rich but screwed up characters house  where the story unravels towards its final moments  i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film makers did their best to translate this to celluloid  it simply didnt work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners  i think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anything  unless youre stuck for a novelty coffee coaster  dont pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket 
"I just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all I can say is...""What did I just watch????"" And I mean that in a good and bad way.<br /><br />The plot is really simple. Stiller and Black play friends/neighbors. Stiller is the focused, hardworker while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo. The idea becomes very popular, and Black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy.<br /><br />As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is plain odd. The direction is odd, with a weird rotating opening shot to out-of-nowhere sped up sequences. The dialouge and the acting is very odd; odd in a rambling sort of way. And the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie, from the weird ""Envy"" song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think you're going to hear a classic 80's song but suddenly it's in Japanese.<br /><br />So, the true question is this...is odd funny? That depends purely on the individual. I was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie. After the screening I heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free. Strangely, I understood their point. There are no jokes whatsoever, so if you aren't hooked by the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie. Absolutely hate it.<br /><br />This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic.

"Watching David&Bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to Sunday school. Despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining. The studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for. Peck portrays King David as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer.

"The subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, exhibitionist movie--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death ""poetry"". To be sure, it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film does contain one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), but with no development leading up to or away from it.

Adele begins dating dashing millionaire Lincoln Palmer (the always fine Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, religious fanatic Helen soon sinks into despair and madness.<br /><br />Director Curtis (""Night Tide,"" ""Ruby"") Harrington, working from a crafty script by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" was based on and co-wrote the screenplay for ""Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte""), adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt, fear, repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok. The super cast have a ball with their colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist, Yvette Vickers as a snippy, overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star, Logan Ramsey as a snoopy detective, and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum. An elaborate talent recital set piece with Pamelyn Ferdin (the voice of Lucy in the ""Peanuts"" TV cartoon specials) serving as emcee and original ""Friday the 13th"" victim Robbi Morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on Mae West impression qualifies as a definite highlight. David Raskin's spooky score, a fantastic scene with Reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant, the flavorsome Depression-era period atmosphere, Lucien Ballard's handsome cinematography, and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective. MGM presents this terrific gem on a nifty DVD doublebill with ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?;"" both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers.",1,the 1930s  classy  elegant adele  marvelously played with dignified resolve by debbie reynolds  and batty  frumpy helen  the magnificent shelley winters going full tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache  are the mothers of two killers  they leave their seamy pasts in the midwest behind and move to hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets  adele begins dating dashing millionaire lincoln palmer  the always fine dennis weaver   on the other hand  religious fanatic helen soon sinks into despair and madness  director curtis   night tide    ruby   harrington  working from a crafty script by henry farrell  who wrote the book  whatever happened to baby jane   was based on and co wrote the screenplay for  hush     hush  sweet charlotte    adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt  fear  repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok  the super cast have a ball with their colorful roles  michael macliammoir as a pompous elocution teacher  agnes moorehead as a stern fire and brimstone radio evangelist  yvette vickers as a snippy  overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star  logan ramsey as a snoopy detective  and timothy carey as a creepy bum  an elaborate talent recital set piece with pamelyn ferdin  the voice of lucy in the  peanuts  tv cartoon specials  serving as emcee and original  friday the 13th  victim robbi morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead on mae west impression qualifies as a definite highlight  david raskins spooky score  a fantastic scene with reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant  the flavorsome depression era period atmosphere  lucien ballards handsome cinematography  and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective  mgm presents this terrific gem on a nifty dvd doublebill with  whoever slew auntie roo    both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers

"Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen... Can somebody tell me where should have I laughed? There's not a single hint or shadow of an idea. The three leading actors are pestilential, especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily who _can't_ make a Sicilian accent!!! Not to say about the dream-like insertion about Dracula... just another expedient, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this ""film"" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was really too, too hard to rescue.

"It is often only after years pass that we can look back and see those stars who are truly stars. As that French film critic, whose name escapes me, said: ""There is no Garbo. There is no Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks""; and there is, thank heavens! Louise Brooks! This is the third of her European masterpieces. But it is also an exceptional film for being one, if not the, first French talkie, for following a script written by famed René Clair, for reportedly being finished (the direction, that is) by Georg Pabst, and for incorporating the voice of Edith Piaf before she was well known! So much talent working on and in a film, how couldn't it turn out to be a masterpiece?! And that's what this film is. It's a shame Louise Brooks was blackballed by Hollywood when she came back to the States--so much talent cast so arrogantly by the wayside! In the film, in addition to getting to watch Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see pictures of Paris ca. 1930 and to hear Piaf's young voice.

"Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America, an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner, are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Bettie's life were all the film was concerned about, then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, she accomplishes this goal admirably, holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own ""enlightened"" 21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism, this is a film needed more than ever.",1,canadian filmmaker mary harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the sixties and the hollow avaricious eighties  with  the notorious bettie page  she points her unswerving eye at fifties america  an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of joe mccarthy  while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade  harron and her co writer guinevere turner  are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol  this is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body  if the details of betties life were all the film was concerned about  then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin  clearly  harron is more interested in americas attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now  together with a fearless lead performance by gretchen mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of w mott hupfel iii  she accomplishes this goal admirably  holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own  enlightened  21st century attitudes towards so called pornography  as america suffocates under a new conservatism  this is a film needed more than ever

"ALIEN LOVE ( As this movie is known in Britain ) is a very strange movie . I don`t mean that it`s an esoteric art house movie in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman , I mean it`s a TVM with swearing , sex , some really good T&A , a bad script and a very retro feel . You can just imagine someone like John Hughes directing this ten years earlier , though of course he would have cut out the T&A <br /><br />Going back to the bad script , one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially Amanda . Why does she pick up Connie at the bar ? Just so she could meet an alien ? Do you see what I mean about retro ? ET , SHORT CIRCUIT and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here . The storyline continues to follow an ill defined , unconvincing and illogical path <br /><br />That said I did find ALIEN LOVE watchable and not only down to the T&A on display .

"As a kid, I loved computer animation although it was EXTREMELY limited and the tools were almost nonexistent. This movie, as I sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost-hypnotic music, shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer. This is a whole-package deal, between the music and the video, that really packs a one-two punch. If you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation, this is a MUST HAVE. <br /><br />I still, almost 20 years later, rate this movie as one of my top 3 favorites. The originality, I think, is still unsurpassed by most of today's McMovies that Hollywood spits out. I am currently wanting to see if I can re-make it on my own; if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a TON of imitation =)",1,as a kid  i loved computer animation although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent  this movie  as i sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost hypnotic music  shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer  this is a whole package deal  between the music and the video  that really packs a one two punch  if you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation  this is a must have   i still  almost 20 years later  rate this movie as one of my top 3 favorites  the originality  i think  is still unsurpassed by most of todays mcmovies that hollywood spits out  i am currently wanting to see if i can re make it on my own  if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a ton of imitation   
"Maybe ""Presque Rien"" is not the best movie ever made... But it is better than many of you have said. I still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one.<br /><br />You Americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies, with a clear beginning, development and outcome. But European movies are less narrative, but makes you think much and feel.<br /><br />Many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie.. The purpose of this one is not show us a simple ""summer loving movie"", with commercial characters who ""fall in love and live happy forever"". Summer Holidays and beach are only a background, and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys.<br /><br />Maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie, because of its 3 parts, showed as flashbacks. These 3 moments are: - Summertime in Pornichet, when they meet and love. - After a year and half living together in Nantes, Mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself. He tries to suicide taking something, and Cedric brings him to hospital. Later, he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that. - The last part, is when Mathieu come back to Pornichet, in winter, alone.. to think about how his life have changed, how his life become to be, and trying to find himself.<br /><br />It's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed among them. But anyway, as I said before... this is not a funny movie. If what someone want to see is meat, for that, we have Belami movies.<br /><br />Presque Rien, what want to show us, is how cruel can be the life, for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life. Mathieu only wants to go away from home, and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness.. But what seemed perfect at the beginning.. later is not as good as he thought, and he become troubled, and feel that he has lost the way of his life. He is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. He finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /><br />So, funny? Is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? only a few.. but this is not a movie for entertainment. Is all about feelings... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness... I, as many others, feel identified with life and problems of Mathieu, and that is what director wanted to do.. a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life.<br /><br />For me, the best homo-themed movie ever.",1,maybe  presque rien  is not the best movie ever made    but it is better than many of you have said  i still havent seen a homo themed movie better than this one  you americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies  with a clear beginning  development and outcome  but european movies are less narrative  but makes you think much and feel  many of you didnt understand the sense of the movie   the purpose of this one is not show us a simple  summer loving movie   with commercial characters who  fall in love and live happy forever   summer holidays and beach are only a background  and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys  maybe some of you didnt understand well this movie  because of its 3 parts  showed as flashbacks  these 3 moments are    summertime in pornichet  when they meet and love    after a year and half living together in nantes  mathieu doesnt go to a psychiatric himself  he tries to suicide taking something  and cedric brings him to hospital  later  he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that    the last part  is when mathieu come back to pornichet  in winter  alone   to think about how his life have changed  how his life become to be  and trying to find himself  its possible that some people couldnt understand all this well  because all the scenes are mixed among them  but anyway  as i said before    this is not a funny movie  if what someone want to see is meat  for that  we have belami movies  presque rien  what want to show us  is how cruel can be the life  for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life  mathieu only wants to go away from home  and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness   but what seemed perfect at the beginning   later is not as good as he thought  and he become troubled  and feel that he has lost the way of his life  he is lost and doesnt know what he really wants to do  or what makes him happy  he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide   so  funny  is not a funny movie  very hot scenes  only a few   but this is not a movie for entertainment  is all about feelings    friendship  love  happiness  unhappiness  pain  depression  loneliness    i  as many others  feel identified with life and problems of mathieu  and that is what director wanted to do   a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boys life  for me  the best homo themed movie ever

Does the dog have something to do with it? He's determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family.<br /><br />This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw on those witch mountain movies.

"This film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. The film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children seek their revenge on another child. In fact, they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium. Here we see what life has wrought on each of them. One is a reclusive sexually repressed patient. Another man is a hustler who has become ill. The third child, a young lady, has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche.<br /><br />This film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving. The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. There is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film. This is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience.",1,this film is  in short  a cinematic masterpiece  the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer  the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child  in fact  they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them  later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium  here we see what life has wrought on each of them  one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient  another man is a hustler who has become ill  the third child  a young lady  has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium  this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche  this film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving  the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written  there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film  this is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience

"Don't get me wrong. ""GoldenEye"" was revolutionary and is definitely the best FPS game to be based on the 007 franchise. But the series had fallen into a FPS rut. Enter ""Everything or Nothing"", which puts Bond in third-person. When I wrote my earlier review for ""From Russia With Love"", I had finished FRWL and just started EON and judged EON a bit harshly. Even though FRWL definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise, EON definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. Missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an SUV, driving an Aston Martin, driving a limousine that is wired to explode, commandeering two different types of tanks a la ""GoldenEye"", riding a motorcycle, flying a helicopter, repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires, and free falling after a plummeting damsel. Sure, vehicle controls are a little clumsy, but the issue here is the variety.<br /><br />As movie adaptations, ""GoldenEye"" and FRWL were all that I could have hoped for. But EON's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a James Bond adventure. This is helped by the impressive cast list of Willem DeFoe, Shannon Elizabeth, Heidi Klum, and Misaki Ito. Judi Dench and John Cleese reprise their movie roles of M and Q, respectively, and Pierce Brosnan, while no Sean Connery, adds credibility to the game's proceedings. All characters resemble the stars, with the disappointing exception of Heidi Klum, who's in-game model doesn't do the real-life model justice. Mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen Bond title tunes.<br /><br />The game also plays tribute to some of the older Bond movies. Willem DeFoe's character is a former colleague of Christopher Walken's baddie from ""A View to a Kill"". Richard Kiel appears as Jaws, the hulking henchman from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker"" in three fight scenes, the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have.<br /><br />Single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as Bond. Like Bond, you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing. The game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth, with plenty of wall and object cover. Unfortunately, unlike FRWL, only one button in EON controls both crouching and wall clinging, so Bond may end up crouching low when he's supposed to be peeking around a corner, and vice-versa. The game also allows players to go into ""Bond reflex"" mode. While you browse your inventory, everything around you will go into super slo-mo, allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with. While this takes some getting used to, eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular ""Bond moments"", such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath, and greatly add to the Bond movie feeling.<br /><br />There are 3 available difficulty levels: Operative, Agent, and Double Oh. On Operative, you can breeze through in a few hours. On Agent, a few weeks. On Double Oh, a few months. The difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission. Garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the Bond girls wear. Some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints, but when all is said and done, no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a Bond movie.<br /><br />Multi-player, unfortunately, is not as thrilling. ""GoldenEye"" still has the best multi-player mode of any Bond game. EON's main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser MI6 agents on a less important mission than Bond's. A more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode. But the single-player mode is the most complete Bond experience to date. The ending, as with most Bond games, is anticlimactic. While the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game, the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing. Also, levels that require Bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error. Still, for any serious Bond fan, not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the Bond films.",1,dont get me wrong   goldeneye  was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise  but the series had fallen into a fps rut  enter  everything or nothing   which puts bond in third person  when i wrote my earlier review for  from russia with love   i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly  even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise  eon definitely is superior in terms of in depth controls and gameplay variety  missions range from standard running and gunning to driving an suv  driving an aston martin  driving a limousine that is wired to explode  commandeering two different types of tanks a la  goldeneye   riding a motorcycle  flying a helicopter  repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires  and free falling after a plummeting damsel  sure  vehicle controls are a little clumsy  but the issue here is the variety  as movie adaptations   goldeneye  and frwl were all that i could have hoped for  but eons original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure  this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe  shannon elizabeth  heidi klum  and misaki ito  judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q  respectively  and pierce brosnan  while no sean connery  adds credibility to the games proceedings  all characters resemble the stars  with the disappointing exception of heidi klum  whos in game model doesnt do the real life model justice  myas theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes  the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies  willem defoes character is a former colleague of christopher walkens baddie from  a view to a kill   richard kiel appears as jaws  the hulking henchman from  the spy who loved me  and  moonraker  in three fight scenes  the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have  single player gameplay mainly consists of standard on foot missions as bond  like bond  you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing  the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth  with plenty of wall and object cover  unfortunately  unlike frwl  only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging  so bond may end up crouching low when hes supposed to be peeking around a corner  and vice versa  the game also allows players to go into  bond reflex  mode  while you browse your inventory  everything around you will go into super slo mo  allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with  while this takes some getting used to  eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular  bond moments   such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath  and greatly add to the bond movie feeling  there are 3 available difficulty levels  operative  agent  and double oh  on operative  you can breeze through in a few hours  on agent  a few weeks  on double oh  a few months  the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission  garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear  some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints  but when all is said and done  no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie  multi player  unfortunately  is not as thrilling   goldeneye  still has the best multi player mode of any bond game  eons main multi player is a co op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bonds  a more standard third person death match can be unlocked from this mode  but the single player mode is the most complete bond experience to date  the ending  as with most bond games  is anticlimactic  while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game  the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing  also  levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error  still  for any serious bond fan  not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films 
"I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is quite good, and get's you wandering about what is to come....... Which is nothing. All open story lines remain open; two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture, save for 1 or 2 very short scenes. I wander if Ilya wouldn't have done better to just completely leave them out.... As for the one remaining character, nothing is done with her either. She just visits some god-awful place, and suddenly the movie isn't about her anymore, but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread, drinking homemade vodka, and apparently flashing each other. Some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling, like the judges of the IFFR, but for me it is just bad taste, bad camera-work, a lousy script and frightfully bad direction. Therefor I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading: 1!",0,i agree with the previous comment  the beginning of the movie is quite good  and gets you wandering about what is to come        which is nothing  all open story lines remain open  two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture  save for 1 or 2 very short scenes  i wander if ilya wouldnt have done better to just completely leave them out     as for the one remaining character  nothing is done with her either  she just visits some god awful place  and suddenly the movie isnt about her anymore  but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread  drinking homemade vodka  and apparently flashing each other  some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling  like the judges of the iffr  but for me it is just bad taste  bad camera work  a lousy script and frightfully bad direction  therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading  1 
"After reading the other tepid reviews and comments, I felt I had to come to bat for this movie.<br /><br />Roeg's films tend to have little to do with one another, and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark.<br /><br />What this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith. The only other film like it-in terms of its religious message-would have to be Tolkin's `The Rapture.'<br /><br />I am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural. It is a simple movie about Catholic faith, miracles, and redemption--though you would never guess it till the end. It is also the only movie I can think of whose resolution turns, literally, on a pun.<br /><br />As a (happily) fallen Catholic myself, I know what the movie is about, and I find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based, then it will go right over you head.<br /><br />As a film-as opposed to a story-`Cold Heaven' it is not ground-breaking. While `The Rapture' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery, `Cold Heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities. There are no striking shots, no edgy effects, no attempts to fit the content to the form. It is workmanlike shooting, but subdued. Nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama. It is a simple story that unfolds simply. It may seem odd; but at the end the mystery is revealed. It looks ambiguous; but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of Catholic dogma.<br /><br />In this regard, `Cold Heaven' has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like `The Sting,' or `The Sixth Sense,' or `Final Descent,' or Polanski's `A Pure Formality.' All of these are films with a trick up their sleeves. They may frustrate you along the way, but they have a point-an obvious one, indeed--but the fun is, at least in part, in having been taken in.<br /><br />Still, even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line, it is worth watching for way it directs-and misdirects-you. Try it-especially if you are, or have ever been, a Catholic.",1,after reading the other tepid reviews and comments  i felt i had to come to bat for this movie  roegs films tend to have little to do with one another  and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark  what this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith  the only other film like it in terms of its religious message would have to be tolkins  the rapture  i am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural  it is a simple movie about catholic faith  miracles  and redemption  though you would never guess it till the end  it is also the only movie i can think of whose resolution turns  literally  on a pun  as a  happily  fallen catholic myself  i know what the movie is about  and i find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between god and man  but if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based  then it will go right over you head  as a film as opposed to a story  cold heaven it is not ground breaking  while  the rapture is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery   cold heaven downplays its own cinematic qualities  there are no striking shots  no edgy effects  no attempts to fit the content to the form  it is workmanlike shooting  but subdued  nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama  it is a simple story that unfolds simply  it may seem odd  but at the end the mystery is revealed  it looks ambiguous  but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of catholic dogma  in this regard   cold heaven has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like  the sting  or  the sixth sense  or  final descent  or polanskis  a pure formality  all of these are films with a trick up their sleeves  they may frustrate you along the way  but they have a point an obvious one  indeed  but the fun is  at least in part  in having been taken in  still  even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line  it is worth watching for way it directs and misdirects you  try it especially if you are  or have ever been  a catholic 
"I haven't yet read the Kurt Vonnegut book this was adapted from, but I am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen. Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It concerns the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the US. His job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked Nazi's and send secret messages to the American's via his weekly radio show. But when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to New York, where various odd plot twists await.<br /><br />If Mother Night has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times. But for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked Nazi in a prison cell. Very much recommended.",1,i havent yet read the kurt vonnegut book this was adapted from  but i am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen  overall  i think this is a very successful adaptation of one of vonneguts novels  it concerns the story of an american living in germany who is recruited as a spy for the us  his job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked nazis and send secret messages to the americans via his weekly radio show  but when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to new york  where various odd plot twists await  if mother night has a problem its that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times  but for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb  and there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked nazi in a prison cell  very much recommended

"Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the town of Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health. The formula hasn't been tested on a human, or even a dead body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. He gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh. Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead. Hood of the living Dead is one piece of trash. The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil, the acting is just horrible especially with Rick' s fake crying for his brother, the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out, and the make up is just lame. It's only fake blood covered over the actors face. The zombies are also modified. They run, growl, and must be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should only scuffle, moan, and must be shot in the brain to die! This film is so horrible, the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest.",0,hood of the living dead is about a young scientist named rick who lives with his brother in the town of oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets  then one night  ricks brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier  desperate  rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula theyve been working on that brings sick blood cells to health  the formula hasnt been tested on a human  or even a dead body but rick is determined to bring his brother back to life  he gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens  so rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh  now rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead  hood of the living dead is one piece of trash  the plot is a direct rip off of resident evil  the acting is just horrible especially with rick s fake crying for his brother  the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out  and the make up is just lame  its only fake blood covered over the actors face  the zombies are also modified  they run  growl  and must be shot in the heart to die  zombies should only scuffle  moan  and must be shot in the brain to die  this film is so horrible  the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film  hood of the living dead gets a 3 out of 10  a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest 
"The problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good, but still not work if the audience doesn't believe that the actor is portraying the person. That's the main issue with ""Young Mr. Lincoln:"" Henry Fonda gives a terrific performance, but I found it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as soft-spoken as Fonda portrays him.<br /><br />This is essentially a courtroom drama with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Whether or not this was a true story, I don't know, but if it isn't, then why tell it using Lincoln as the central character? Never mind though. In the film, Lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder.<br /><br />There's really not much to the film, and as a result, it seems rather empty. I wanted more story and character development. The film is 100 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. There are some little scenes featuring Lincoln and the blooming relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial.<br /><br />The acting is good all around, but as I said, Fonda's performance works as a character, but not Abraham Lincoln. I just don't believe that the real Lincoln was that soft-spoken. True, he has a big voice when he needs to, such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial, but Fonda portrays Lincoln too meekly. The other performances are solid though, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She's a nice lady who we can really feel for. Simple and uneducated, yet very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her.<br /><br />John Ford seems to think of this film as an epic, and at the time of its release, it probably was. But even then, there's just not enough material to present it as such.<br /><br />It's a nice watch, but not a classic.",1,the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good  but still not work if the audience doesnt believe that the actor is portraying the person  thats the main issue with  young mr  lincoln   henry fonda gives a terrific performance  but i found it hard to believe that abraham lincoln was as soft spoken as fonda portrays him  this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young abraham licoln at the forefront  whether or not this was a true story  i dont know  but if it isnt  then why tell it using lincoln as the central character  never mind though  in the film  lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder  theres really not much to the film  and as a result  it seems rather empty  i wanted more story and character development  the film is 100 minutes long  but it doesnt feel like it  there are some little scenes featuring lincoln and the blooming relationship with mary todd  but they seem superficial  the acting is good all around  but as i said  fondas performance works as a character  but not abraham lincoln  i just dont believe that the real lincoln was that soft spoken  true  he has a big voice when he needs to  such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial  but fonda portrays lincoln too meekly  the other performances are solid though  especially alice brady as abigail clay  the mother of the accused  shes a nice lady who we can really feel for  simple and uneducated  yet very sweet  we can see why lincoln wanted to help her  john ford seems to think of this film as an epic  and at the time of its release  it probably was  but even then  theres just not enough material to present it as such  its a nice watch  but not a classic 
"After all, you do not go to an Orson Welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy-ever-after star<br /><br />You go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings, lighted and scored imaginatively, photographed bravely, and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place <br /><br />As usual, as well as directing, Welles wrote the script and he also played the hero  a young Irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil, but still retained his clear-eyed trust in the goodness of others Unfortunately for him, he reposed this trust in Rita Hayworth, whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future She was married without love, to an impotent, crippled advocate, acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant Everett Sloane <br /><br />There is a youthful romanticism underlying it all, and this quality came into exuberant play in ""The Lady from Shanghai.""

"Kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama, and the acting is true to the story, with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale. It is touching, funny and intriguing in all parts. The character development is near perfect, the cinematography is vivid and engaging, and the story draws you in.<br /><br />I would like to say that the ""Samurai freaks"" and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of Japan may snub this film as not Kurosawa's best work. Perhaps not his best, but even at his worst, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change, that it is timeless, despite being set in the not-so-distant past.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend this to any movie buff, and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based.",1,kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama  and the acting is true to the story  with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale  it is touching  funny and intriguing in all parts  the character development is near perfect  the cinematography is vivid and engaging  and the story draws you in  i would like to say that the  samurai freaks  and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of japan may snub this film as not kurosawas best work  perhaps not his best  but even at his worst  kurosawa is better than many of the best  this story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change  that it is timeless  despite being set in the not so distant past  i would heartily recommend this to any movie buff  and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based 
"American Pie: Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes. On the other hand, it's porno that's a tad too soft-core to actually turn on any viewers. Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others just lame attempts at humor - with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness. The characters are barely even two-dimensional, most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile, and the ""important"" plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story.<br /><br />In all fairness, I did not go into this movie without expectations. I liked the original three American Pie movies, and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning for Beta House, I was excited to see this installment. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked. They spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story.<br /><br />This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental. The jokes are lame, the story is non-existent, and the porno-aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing.",0,american pie  beta house is sort of in limbo between genres  on the one hand  its a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes  on the other hand  its porno thats a tad too soft core to actually turn on any viewers  essentially beta house is a collage of sex scenes   some humiliating  others just lame attempts at humor   with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness  the characters are barely even two dimensional  most development relies on knowledge of naked mile  and the  important  plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story  in all fairness  i did not go into this movie without expectations  i liked the original three american pie movies  and thought band camp and naked mile were solid rentals  i thought naked mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters  and so when i saw that some of the same characters were returning for beta house  i was excited to see this installment  i was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms  and i was fine with it  because in the past  these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot  in beta house  however  its almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other ap movies worked  they spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story  this movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one dollar rental  the jokes are lame  the story is non existent  and the porno aspect is too tame if thats all you really care about seeing 
"It starts slowly, showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but don't give up on it. Nothing much happens, but the time passes exquisitely, and there are numerous sly jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I find hilarious). The movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful (as is Polly Walker), and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying.<br /><br />The movie takes a couple of liberties with the book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot/Briggs/Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie's version of this (it may be more sentimental, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway I like sentiment when it's well done).<br /><br />An excellent movie, especially as a date movie during lousy weather.",1,it starts slowly  showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april  but dont give up on it  nothing much happens  but the time passes exquisitely  and there are numerous sly jokes  my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm  which i find hilarious   the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word  the scenery is beautiful  as is polly walker   and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying  the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book  the biggest being with the arbuthnot briggs dester business  but i actually preferred the movies version of this  it may be more sentimental  but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story  and anyway i like sentiment when its well done   an excellent movie  especially as a date movie during lousy weather

"I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite remarkable film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the way it should be. What we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be. What we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br />",1,i just saw this last night  it was broadcast on the canadian broadcasting corporations passionate eye series  it has been screened recently  sept  2003  at the toronto international film festival as well as many others  it is a quite remarkable film  the filmmakers literally stumbled into the story  being there to make a documentary about chavez himself  instead  they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded  they had unprecedented access to events and people and  for the most part  let the story unfold as it happens  they  of course  have their own ideological perspective  which they make evident  but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events  the people  and the background and history leading up to the coup  as a film  it is not ground breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense  and that is  i think  the way it should be  what we get to see what embedded journalism should really be  what we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy    a charismatic leader  chavez  who actually cares for his people    a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate military media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader    and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds 
"The plot was dull, the girls were sickening and the supposed Italian male lead had clearly never heard an Italian accent.Someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people. There were literally no redeeming features about this film.<br /><br />I think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business.

"I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any film I have seen in years. A successful band from the 70's decide to give it another try. They start by playing some gigs in some seedy European venues, with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and acting are terrific. The characters are spot on, especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice, makeup and personality problems. The concert at the end was unreal. Go and see it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)",1,i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years  a successful band from the 70s decide to give it another try  they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues  with hilarious results  the music is fantastic  the script and acting are terrific  the characters are spot on  especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice  makeup and personality problems  the concert at the end was unreal  go and see it  preferably in a cinema with a good sound system

"Never saw the original movie in the series...I only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80's, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's ""The Town the Dreaded Sundown"".",0,never saw the original movie in the series   i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified  this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now  anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie  it was  however  a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark  really  this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen  the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm  other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid  the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water  not really worth watching i would however like to see the original  granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80s  but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70s  the town the dreaded sundown  
"Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's art-house style that was considered ""old"" and out-of-date a few years ago. The cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. I did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what-is-this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.",0,despite being a 2001 movie  the direction is the kind of 90s art house style that was considered  old  and out of date a few years ago  the cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch  the script is decent enough  and a few scenes did kind of captivate me  like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night   but the story line with the detective whos sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible  the performance by the actor who plays selma blairs married boyfriend seriously bothered me  i did sit through the whole thing  though  which is rare for the kind of random  what is this movie you just find on tv and decide to watch 
"Who votes in these ratings? ""Jacknife"" is a beautifully acted, brilliantly observed piece of work, with actors on top of their game, especially Ed Harris and the peerless Robert DeNiro(please don't mention Marlon Brando in the same breath of this man-see ""Taxi Driver"" for confirmation of this point). Is it a 'mundane' movie because it doesn't have sex/meaningless action/nudity in it. This movie is about the complexities of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking. The part where he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and the movies exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men must feel to see a young upstart sporting military attire. While we are on this subject, ""Casino"" 7.8 out of 10?

"I'm not sure how I missed this one when it first came out, but I am glad to have finally seen it.<br /><br />This movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of Okabasho, Japan. It tells the tale of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of Japan.<br /><br />It is uniquely Akira Kurosawa! Even though he died before he could direct this movie, his adaptation of the screenplay shows. His view of the Japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other. The characters may revolve around each other, but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in. The samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitute's world goes back to his life, while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste system..lowest of the low. Many prize the world of the samurai above all others, but yet, it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint. The samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one, while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones. <br /><br />The movie deserves a higher rating. It is a tale of survival of women in feudal Japan. During this time frame, men were thought to be the survivors..the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property. This movie highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival, and how their strength enabled the Japanese culture to continue on as it has.<br /><br />I recommend ""The Sea is Watching"" to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they're not a fan. It is a lovely, quiet and soul sustaining movie, and one to be treasured for any movie collection.",1,im not sure how i missed this one when it first came out  but i am glad to have finally seen it  this movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of okabasho  japan  it tells the tale of prostitution  caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of japan  it is uniquely akira kurosawa  even though he died before he could direct this movie  his adaptation of the screenplay shows  his view of the japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other  the characters may revolve around each other  but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in  the samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitutes world goes back to his life  while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste system  lowest of the low  many prize the world of the samurai above all others  but yet  it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint  the samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one  while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones   the movie deserves a higher rating  it is a tale of survival of women in feudal japan  during this time frame  men were thought to be the survivors  the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property  this movie highlights the strength of japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival  and how their strength enabled the japanese culture to continue on as it has  i recommend  the sea is watching  to anyone who is a fan of akira kurosawa and even if theyre not a fan  it is a lovely  quiet and soul sustaining movie  and one to be treasured for any movie collection 
"If you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch ""Waking Life,"" which is brilliant. ""What the #$*!

It wasn't thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. The inclusion of that rambling freak ""Ramtha"" in this film is reason enough to avoid it.

"I may not have the longest of attention-spans, but this is the second movie I have refused to see all the way through, and I even bought it on DVD because of its ""classic"" status. <br /><br />At first, I thought that the director was playing a big joke, so I kept waiting for a resolution, something to laugh at, something to keep my interest, but this resolution never came. Rather, the writing was laughably amateurish, the movie dragged on and felt disjointed, like someone cut a TV series to feature-length. The Academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight Oscars.<br /><br />Once again, I repeat myself.

"I caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college's gaming club. We were forewarned that this would be the ""reefer madness"" of gaming, and this movie more than delivered.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man re-starting his college career after ""resting"" for a semester. What we, the viewer, find out as the movie progresses, is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called ""Mazes and Monsters,"" a game that he gets re-acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign.<br /><br />This movie is laughable on many, many levels. One scene features the group ""gaming by candlelight,"" which is probably the best way I can describe it. While I'm sure that this was meant to be ""cultish"" in some way, as most gamers know, it's horribly inaccurate. Most role-play sessions are done in well-lit rooms, usually over some chee-tohs and a can of soda.<br /><br />The acting, while not Oscar-caliber, isn't gut-wrenchingly awful either. This is one of Tom Hanks's first roles, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two over the horizon. The supporting cast, while not very memorable, still hand forth decent performances.<br /><br />Mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made-for-TV movie that shows the ""dangers of gaming"" Worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.",0,i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my colleges gaming club  we were forewarned that this would be the  reefer madness  of gaming  and this movie more than delivered  tom hanks plays robbie  a young man re starting his college career after  resting  for a semester  what we  the viewer  find out as the movie progresses  is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role playing game called  mazes and monsters   a game that he gets re acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign  this movie is laughable on many  many levels  one scene features the group  gaming by candlelight   which is probably the best way i can describe it  while im sure that this was meant to be  cultish  in some way  as most gamers know  its horribly inaccurate  most role play sessions are done in well lit rooms  usually over some chee tohs and a can of soda  the acting  while not oscar caliber  isnt gut wrenchingly awful either  this is one of tom hankss first roles  and bosom buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon  the supporting cast  while not very memorable  still hand forth decent performances  mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made for tv movie that shows the  dangers of gaming  worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night 
"We've all been there, sitting with some friends watching a bad movie, laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was; eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says ""how is it possible such a movie was made? who paid money to have this script made into a feature film?"" Well Jigsaw is not that kind of film, instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun. Yes, Jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived, this coming from a guy who has seen Campfire Stories and Fever Lake. The film starts out in some kind of college class, what kind of class I am unsure, but it is imagined to be an art class. Now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher, five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit, and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic A, oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free A, good for her! A week passes and the five students, plus teacher, plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project, they put the pieces together, head, arms, legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs, now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage, one puts a saw blade in the left hand, the other gets a sawed off shotgun, the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings, the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye, ala Hellraiser 3, with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo-hawk. After they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin, now aptly named Jigsaw. Now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair, bad acting, dialog and everything else, but has still been pretty plausible, yet after Jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst...Jigsaw comes alive.. How you ask? I have no idea, he just does because the writers couldn't think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive (Come on guys, a bolt of lighting, a traveling voodoo priest, anything could have worked.) So once Jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc. First he kills the cool guy with some barb wire, this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him. With him gone Jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head, he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband; Jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception. Did I mention Jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself? No! Well its not important they don't even show his macabre creation, they don't even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators (Maybe he was trying to create the head detective from In Living Color). So after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left, the teacher figures out that Jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece, since he is still uninterested in that torso thing. So being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to Jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which isn't even plugged in. That is where the freaking movie ends, we don't even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl, let alone an explanation why Jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned. This movie is so shameful it has too be seen, it is only 71 minutes so it is a small part of your day; For the memories of a lifetime, Jigsaw, Jigsaw, Jigsaw. Thank you Total Recall!

"The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic's Top 100. For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie; indeed, I had to look hard to find a copy, I got the DVD version for about half-price. Surprisingly it was only rated M15+ (the uncut version).<br /><br />I doubt many will take notice of this review (more like comment) so I'll make it brief.<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I've seen, partly because of the use of montages, artistic filming (very art-house) and the unusual theme. There are many things in the film I still don't understand (I've seen it twice), and it makes for an emotionally confusing film.<br /><br />The filming and acting were very good, and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a 'cowboy' from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the crippled conman Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, of course they become friends going through the usual escapades. What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different.<br /><br />I felt the film didn't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection, although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews, but its pretty obvious from the start.<br /><br />I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes. The deprivation of humanity (shown by the darkness of the city streets, the breaking-down tenements). Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law (a conman, giggolo.etc) yet you can't help liking them. Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic, while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film.<br /><br />I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground-breaking for its period. At the time (And even now) it was definitely not a typical movie (quite art-house). At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns, musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up.<br /><br />On a personal level, I must say I quite liked the film. The imagery conveyed a dream-like quality. I particularly liked the scene at the party, the music, images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching. However, as a movie for entertainment's sake it was a bit lacking (not really my style of movie) in thrills. This is a film to be savoured and appreciated, rather than a cheap thrills action flick.<br /><br />Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film, the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks, Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother, although it still doesn't seem to be relevant to the story. He is a happy-go-lucky young stud, who suppresses his darker memories. The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, although I fail to see where they have got the idea from. The theme of homo-sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation, and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man, but it has little to do with the main story.<br /><br />Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade (it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel) and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do. While it has a simple, sentimental story to it (disguised by a hard edge) the beauty of the film is in the strange, often psychedelic sequences.",1,the only reason i knew of midnight cowboy was because it was in the afi critics top 100  for a top 100 it is not a very well known movie  indeed  i had to look hard to find a copy  i got the dvd version for about half price  surprisingly it was only rated m15   the uncut version   i doubt many will take notice of this review  more like comment  so ill make it brief  this is perhaps one of the strangest movies ive seen  partly because of the use of montages  artistic filming  very art house  and the unusual theme  there are many things in the film i still dont understand  ive seen it twice   and it makes for an emotionally confusing film  the filming and acting were very good  and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable  the main character is joe buck  a cowboy from texas who moves to new york to become a male prostitute  he meets the crippled conman enrico ratso rizzo and  of course they become friends going through the usual escapades  what makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different  i felt the film didnt really develop the relationship between buck and enrico rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection  although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic  you probably already know what happens by reading the reviews  but its pretty obvious from the start  i personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes  the deprivation of humanity  shown by the darkness of the city streets  the breaking down tenements   most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law  a conman  giggolo etc  yet you cant help liking them  joe buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic  while we begin to feel pity for ratso later in the film  i think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground breaking for its period  at the time  and even now  it was definitely not a typical movie  quite art house   at a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns  musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as midnight cowboy pops up  on a personal level  i must say i quite liked the film  the imagery conveyed a dream like quality  i particularly liked the scene at the party  the music  images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching  however  as a movie for entertainments sake it was a bit lacking  not really my style of movie  in thrills  this is a film to be savoured and appreciated  rather than a cheap thrills action flick  although i would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film  the characters and their motives were quite interesting  from what i understand from the flashbacks  joe buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother  although it still doesnt seem to be relevant to the story  he is a happy go lucky young stud  who suppresses his darker memories  the religious connotations in the film are also puzzling  some have suggested a homosexual connection between buck and ratso  although i fail to see where they have got the idea from  the theme of homo sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation  and later in joe bucks encounter with a lonely old man  but it has little to do with the main story  certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade  it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel  and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do  while it has a simple  sentimental story to it  disguised by a hard edge  the beauty of the film is in the strange  often psychedelic sequences 
"I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.<br /><br />I should have known better.<br /><br />This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone. It holds absolutely NONE of the originals super charm! It seems, to me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from the (don't)Sing-a-longs to the characterization.<br /><br />While I remember the character's telling a story through a song, this film's soundtrack was laid over the top, and didn't seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example: Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there's old barn dance type country music. It's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set. The upbeat fiddles certainly didn't fit.<br /><br />Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original. The artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderella's hoop skirt, which doesn't feel right.<br /><br />The movie itself could have been it's own story, I think that it should have been just that. I wouldn't say that I hate it, but I believe that it had many shortcomings. It seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original.",0,i grew up watching the original disney cinderella  and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn  accordingly  i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see it  i should have known better  this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone  it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm  it seems  to me  quite rough  and almost brutal  right from the  dont sing a longs to the characterization  while i remember the characters telling a story through a song  this films soundtrack was laid over the top  and didnt seem to fit  jaqs transformation into a human is a prime example  where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there  he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall  and in the ballroom  theres old barn dance type country music  its as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set  the upbeat fiddles certainly didnt fit  even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isnt up to scratch with the original  the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed  and we see part of cinderellas hoop skirt  which doesnt feel right  the movie itself could have been its own story  i think that it should have been just that  i wouldnt say that i hate it  but i believe that it had many shortcomings  it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original 
"I am the parent of a special needs child and I enjoyed the the movie very much! It was loving, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago to see the humor in things. I especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died. I attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited. Everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions. We talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them. The screenwriter talked about how she work with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years. She based the character on a real person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very stressful times. I give the movie two thumbs up!!!",1,i am the parent of a special needs child and i enjoyed the the movie very much  it was loving  warm and fun  i learned a long time ago to see the humor in things  i especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died  i attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited  everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions  we talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them  the screenwriter talked about how she work with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years  she based the character on a real person  our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very stressful times  i give the movie two thumbs up   
"Times are tough for Angel Town, gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (Mainly due to embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid, Martine to join the gangs, so they beat him up everyday. However due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier ""World's lamest actor"" Gruner) named Jacques, hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made (And I've seen my share) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need, are French kick-boxers who can't act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it's just truly hilarious. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: ""You like the fighting? (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock) I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason why I don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him, and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me, that's why he doesn't die!"" <br /><br />Of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone, let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation. Odd.<br /><br />However don't let me make this sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it's so terrible it's priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang-members who (the film's biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols. Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs, while Gruner kick-boxes the rest. All of this set to the sound of horrible ""Mexican"" accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this.<br /><br />The other treat about this movie, is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend (In a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level, this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand make sure to down tequila, like the laughable opening song details ""Ain't no mercy in Angel Town"" <br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)",0,times are tough for angel town  gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown  mainly due to embarrassing writing  the gangs want a street kid  martine to join the gangs  so they beat him up everyday  however due to the presence of an olympic kick boxer  olivier  worlds lamest actor  gruner  named jacques  hope is on the way  angel town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made  and ive seen my share  it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need  are french kick boxers who cant act  worst of all there are so many awkward moments its just truly hilarious  best of all comes from the exchange between gruner and aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is  to wit   you like the fighting   olivier grabs his asian best friend in a headlock  i could kill him right  when i want him dead he dies  the reason why i dont want him dead is because im afraid of him  and i know that if i kill him his son and wife will kill me  thats why he doesnt die    of course the fact that its wrong to kill someone  let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation  odd  however dont let me make this sound that i hated this movie  far from it  its so terrible its priceless  the biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees grunner going one on one with gang members who  the films biggest logic gap decline the use of pistols  also a handicapped vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs  while gruner kick boxes the rest  all of this set to the sound of horrible  mexican  accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this  the other treat about this movie  is that for some reason olivier gruner never attends college despite thats the main reason hes here in the states and not in france getting it on with his girlfriend  in a graveyard in the films awkward beginning  angel town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level  this is the perfect movie for you  on the other hand make sure to down tequila  like the laughable opening song details  aint no mercy in angel town     out of 4  bad 
"When I was 17 my high school staged Bye Bye Birdie - which is no great surprise, since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the world.<br /><br />I was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs, as well as a lingering disregard for the Dick Van Dyke movie version which had (deliberately) obscured the Elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience.<br /><br />So, when the 1995 version starring Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander turns in an exceptional performance as Albert, a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain TV series. The remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part, supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl).<br /><br />But best of all, the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be (allowing for the absence of a stage).<br /><br />So, if you know the musical (and few do not), then check out this telemovie. It does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered, which is good enough for me. What is better than rendering a writer's work faithfully and with colour and style?",1,when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye birdie   which is no great surprise  since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most staged musical in the world  i was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs  as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had  deliberately  obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience  so  when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen  i was delighted with what i saw  alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert  a performance in strong contrast to his better known persona from a certain tv series  the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles  chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part  supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl   but best of all  the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be  allowing for the absence of a stage   so  if you know the musical  and few do not   then check out this telemovie  it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered  which is good enough for me  what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style 
"This movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today. Very, very funny. It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it ""builds"" from there. Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's....clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely. I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it.

"BSG is one of my all time favourite TV series. I was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was! <br /><br />As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu I knew exactly what I was in for just by the title - Caprica! Although, some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed. There were no mention about the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe I haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why.<br /><br />I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology, and alternate fantasies of our world.

"I am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on Stephen King's books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable.<br /><br />I have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and I still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary.<br /><br />The scene where Gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out.

"This movie makes no sense at all, there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous NYPD vehicles through. The characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever. I will put my comments in the chat board, but save your time and money, this is stupid. I can't stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music, and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level. But it is nice to see Denzel W. prevail over the Man, who comes in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt. Von Trapp. There is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice.",0,this movie makes no sense at all  there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous nypd vehicles through  the characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever  i will put my comments in the chat board  but save your time and money  this is stupid  i cant stand when hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music  and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level  but it is nice to see denzel w  prevail over the man  who comes in 3 flavors  jodi foster  mayor bloomberg and capt  von trapp  there is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice 
"First off, the title character is not even the main character of the movie. He is the sidekick of the cult leader. The actor who portrays Igor believed that screaming loud, laughing hysterically, and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of yelling (because he never actually just spoke) in a high pitched voice. He would also say idiotic one-liners. For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw, Igor upon seeing this, yells out ""Paul! No Paul! Why'd you do it? I could have cut her clean! So clean!"" In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now, it was his time to operate.' Aside from the bad acting, the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax, which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed, he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining 'good guys'. The movie offers no explanation of this, only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital. What??? Bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie.

"At the height of the 'Celebrity Big Brother' racism row in 2007 ( involving Shilpa Shetty and the late Jade Goody ), I condemned on an internet forum those 'C.B.B.' fans who praised the show, after years of bashing 'racist' '70's sitcoms such as 'Curry & Chips' & 'Love Thy Neighbour'. I thought they were being hypocritical, and said so. 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' was then thrown into the argument, with some pointing out it had starred an English actor blacked-up. Well, yes, but Michael Bates had lived in India as a boy, and spoke Urdu fluently. The show's detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer 'Rangi Ram'. The noted Indian character actor, Renu Setna, said in a 1995 documentary 'Perry & Croft: The Sitcoms' that he was upset when he heard Bates had landed the role, but added: ""No Indian actor could have played that role as well as Bates."". Indeed.<br /><br />'Mum' was Perry and Croft's companion show to 'Dad's Army'; also set in wartime, the sedate English town of Walmington-On-Sea had been replaced by the hot, steamy jungles of India, in particularly a place called Deolali, where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops, among them Bombadier Solomons ( George Layton, his first sitcom role since 'Doctor In Charge' ), camp Gunner 'Gloria' Beaumont ( Melvyn Hayes ), diminutive Gunner 'Lofty' Sugden, 'Lah de-dah' Gunner Graham ( John Clegg ), and Gunner Parkins ( the late Christopher Mitchell ). Presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose Sergeant-Major Williams ( the brilliant Windsor Davies ), who regarded them all as 'poofs'. His frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying ( though he was nice to Parkins, whom he thought was his illegitimate son! ). Then there was ever-so English Colonel Reynolds ( Donald Hewlett ) and dimwitted Captain Ashwood ( Michael Knowles ). Rangi was like a wise old sage, beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure Hindu proverbs. He loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically British. His friends were the tea-making Char Wallah ( the late Dino Shafeek, who went on to 'Mind Your Language' ) and the rope pulling Punka Wallah ( Babar Bhatti ). So real Indians featured in the show - another point its detractors ignore. Shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as 'vocal interruptions' ( similar to the '40's songs used as incidental music on 'Dad's Army' ). Each edition closed with him warbling 'Land Of Hope & Glory' only to be silenced by a 'Shut Up!' from Williams. The excellent opening theme was penned by Jimmy Perry and Derek Taverner.<br /><br />Though never quite equalling 'Dad's Army' in the public's affections, 'Mum' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons. In 1975, Davies and Estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut 'Whispering Grass'. They then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts, entitled ( what else? ) 'Sing Lofty!'.<br /><br />The show hit crisis point three years later when Bates died of cancer. Rather than recast the role of 'Rangi', the writers just let him be quietly forgotten. When George Layton left, the character of 'Gloria' took his place as 'Bombadier', providing another source of comedy.<br /><br />The last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave India by boat for Blighty, the Char Wallah watching them go with great sadness ( as did viewers ).<br /><br />Repeats have been few and far between ( mainly on U.K. Gold ) all because of its so-called 'dodgy' reputation. This is strange. For one thing, the show was not specifically about racism. If a white man blacked-up is so wrong, why does David Lean's 1984 film 'A Passage to India' still get shown on television? ( it featured Alec Guinness as an Indian, and won two Oscars! ). It was derived from Jimmy Perry's own experiences. Some characters were based on real people ( the Sergeant-Major really did refer to his men as 'poofs' ). I take the view that if you are going to put history on television, get it right. Sanitizing the past, no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences, is fundamentally dishonest. 'Mum' was both funny and truthful, and viewers saw this. Thank heavens for D.V.D.'s I say. Time to stop this review.

"Utterly brilliant. Powerful and evocative. The most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war. It's tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung-ho attitude towards World War 2 that the media exhibits. Rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war, it allows Sir Laurence Olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocents. Most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of ""civility"" are removed. There is something distinctly Hobbesian about man in a true state of nature, he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on. Perhaps there could be a follow up series called ""The century at war"" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. I feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this.",1,utterly brilliant  powerful and evocative  the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war  its tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media exhibits  rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war  it allows sir laurence oliviers quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war  corpses everywhere  explosions  terrified citizens and soldiers  broken men  indifferent politicians  mistakes that cost thousands of lives  the suffering of the innocents  most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of  civility  are removed  there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature  he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on  perhaps there could be a follow up series called  the century at war  for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors  i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this 
"It's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at Regency Films (and later with Fox): cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on ""Fatal Attraction""...voilà! I don't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved, unless the pay was just too tempting. A dateless employee at an architectural design firm in N.Y.C. meets a girl on the subway and asks her out; despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant, he eventually gets her into bed--only to find out later she's the Big Apple's resident superhero, G-Girl. This distaff Superman, with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite, isn't a fantasy heroine, however...screenwriter Don Payne has conceived her as a needy, possessive, vindictive bitch (he telegraphs this to us from miles away, though Uma Thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs). This is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by. Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson, talking with Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by a sour dig at gays (it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies' men). After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis, who wants to zap her powers, Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned...and isn't that better after all? Thurman's early performances in films like ""Henry & June"" and ""Jennifer 8"" showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity, but that came at a price (the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch). The picture is exceedingly well-produced and shot, with expensive-seeming special effects, yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario. It's pushy, leering, ugly, and badly-cast. Bloated, frozen-faced Wilson can't tell any of his co-workers that he's dating G-Girl because she made him swear he'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up his rectum. I wonder if writer Payne actually thought that was hilarious...or, indeed, if anyone involved did? * from ****",0,its easy to see how this below average screenplay got by in the early sales pitch meetings at regency films  and later with fox   cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on  fatal attraction    voilà  i dont know how on earth a talented director like ivan reitman got involved  unless the pay was just too tempting  a dateless employee at an architectural design firm in n y c  meets a girl on the subway and asks her out  despite the fact shes distracted and unpleasant  he eventually gets her into bed  only to find out later shes the big apples resident superhero  g girl  this distaff superman  with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite  isnt a fantasy heroine  however   screenwriter don payne has conceived her as a needy  possessive  vindictive bitch  he telegraphs this to us from miles away  though uma thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs   this is the kind of worthless movie that cant let an insult slip by  our introduction to leading man luke wilson  talking with rainn wilson on the train  is accompanied by a sour dig at gays  it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies men   after being approached by g girls nemesis  who wants to zap her powers  wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned   and isnt that better after all  thurmans early performances in films like  henry   june  and  jennifer 8  showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise  her films with quentin tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity  but that came at a price  the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch   the picture is exceedingly well produced and shot  with expensive seeming special effects  yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario  its pushy  leering  ugly  and badly cast  bloated  frozen faced wilson cant tell any of his co workers that hes dating g girl because she made him swear hed rather have a chainsaw stuck up his rectum  i wonder if writer payne actually thought that was hilarious   or  indeed  if anyone involved did    from     
"I watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favourites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I've never seen anything like before. Heston casually getting into bed with the ""furniture"" while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. Ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Luckily, I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. Then I watched it again, and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice script - and some great sets too.

"A heartwarming film. The usual superb acting by John Thaw, who passed over recently. A man who was always so unassuming. He was one of Englands top 10 actors certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his famous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A must see for all the family and a great DVD for my collection. The filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings.

"I must say that I was disapointed with this film. I have never been a huge BNL fans, I find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic (this is me in grade 9, if i had a million dollars, shoe box of life etc). However, I have seen clips of their live show and I really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show. I was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is, unfortunately, the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling (there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring, despite how much Jim Creegan was digging himself). The film does not and shows only a few minutes of it (and you know they've had better moments, as in the Afgahnistan concert ""Koffee Anan, he's the man in charge, my name's Steve Paige and I'm really large"") .<br /><br />BNL are kind of like when I went to Europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull ""Blue"" song by Effeil 99 or whatever every 2 minutes, I came back to Canada and then a month later that song was all over the place *again*, I nearly chewed off my own arm. BNL is like that, years ago I remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in Canada listening to people play ""If I had a million dollars"". BNL was a cult phenomenon in Canada, and much of their humour has a particular Canadian slant to it (Kraft Dinner is a staple for many students up here, and the name ""Gordon"" is quintessentially Canadian) a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and I was somewhat gratefull. Then all of a sudden they become huge in States, and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band (yeah, they're brand new, but they're all in their 30's!) while the rest of Canada is going ""Oh geez, I thought those guys folded years ago, do I have to listen to 'million dollars' again?""<br /><br />The concert footage is not bad, but I would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine, the shooting is not that great, and things like clips from their massive free show in Boston are glazed over much too quickly. The interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys, I think they're all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit. There are times when they go into Spinal Tap type of material, where they deliver deadpan satire, then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it. The interviews with Moses Znaimer (a Canadian media mogule) and Terry David Mulligan (Music dude) are extremely pretentious and verge into Tap territory unintentionally.<br /><br />This movie doesn't really document very much either, I mean, it's basically one show and at the start of the film, they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage, it's not like we see them rising from obscurity and ""surprise"" they are popular, it's a methodically planned out event, so in the end it's rather lifeless, kind of half live concert, half documentary, and not much of either.<br /><br />",0,i must say that i was disapointed with this film  i have never been a huge bnl fans  i find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic  this is me in grade 9  if i had a million dollars  shoe box of life etc   however  i have seen clips of their live show and i really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show  i was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is  unfortunately  the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling  there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring  despite how much jim creegan was digging himself   the film does not and shows only a few minutes of it  and you know theyve had better moments  as in the afgahnistan concert  koffee anan  hes the man in charge  my names steve paige and im really large     bnl are kind of like when i went to europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull  blue  song by effeil 99 or whatever every 2 minutes  i came back to canada and then a month later that song was all over the place  again   i nearly chewed off my own arm  bnl is like that  years ago i remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in canada listening to people play  if i had a million dollars   bnl was a cult phenomenon in canada  and much of their humour has a particular canadian slant to it  kraft dinner is a staple for many students up here  and the name  gordon  is quintessentially canadian  a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and i was somewhat gratefull  then all of a sudden they become huge in states  and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band  yeah  theyre brand new  but theyre all in their 30s   while the rest of canada is going  oh geez  i thought those guys folded years ago  do i have to listen to million dollars again   the concert footage is not bad  but i would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine  the shooting is not that great  and things like clips from their massive free show in boston are glazed over much too quickly  the interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys  i think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit  there are times when they go into spinal tap type of material  where they deliver deadpan satire  then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it  the interviews with moses znaimer  a canadian media mogule  and terry david mulligan  music dude  are extremely pretentious and verge into tap territory unintentionally  this movie doesnt really document very much either  i mean  its basically one show and at the start of the film  they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage  its not like we see them rising from obscurity and  surprise  they are popular  its a methodically planned out event  so in the end its rather lifeless  kind of half live concert  half documentary  and not much of either

"I am a fan of animal movies. If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over. Homeward Bound did just this. They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it. It was a complete success. It is very much an archetypal movie. You have the obi-wan of the group(shadow) who is wise and logical, you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting Chance, and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities bounce off of each other very well. I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters, and they did not overdue it. Most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film. What they are forgetting, however, is that it is supposed to be a kids film, and this still does not take away from the acual movie. This is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie. It is a Disney movie without the cartoons, an air bud movie with a better plot.

"Predictable, hackneyed & poorly written. Foolishly I reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit.

Early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since. The movie lacked intrigue, giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder. Some of the discourse was, frankly, embarrassing!

"I considered myself to be quite melancholy, especially when I watch a great touching and tear-jerking movies. But not for this one (which surprised me!) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly.<br /><br />There are several disturbing facts throughout the movies: 1. Despite guilt-ridden Ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action. Some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly, in the end this was a disturbing action to me.<br /><br />2. The movie story line is over-dramatized, but the logic is over-simplified. Medically, blood type match is required to be an organ donor. Toward the end of the film we learnt that Emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type, same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently, despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart, but also his kidney, his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen.<br /><br />3. Why the doctors allow Ben's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself?<br /><br />I might be over-analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie. However, some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie. If you go for a soap-opera type of film, go for it.

"THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT, like I'M ALL RIGHT JACK, takes a dim view of both labor and capital. Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one (he has never gotten his university degree due to an...err...accident in a college laboratory). He manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry. When the film begins he is in Michael Gough's company, and Gough (in a memorable moment) is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law (Cecil Parker) by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs. While having lunch with Parker and Parker's daughter (Joan Greenwood), Gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab's unexpectedly large budget problems. He reads the huge expenditures (due to Guinness's experiments), and chokes on his coffee.<br /><br />Guinness goes on to work at Parker's firm, and repeats the same tricks he did with Gough - but Parker discovers it too. Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on, and convinces Parker to continue the experiments (but now legally). The result: Guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it's molecular structure so that (for all intents and purposes) the fiber will remain in tact for good. Any textile made from it will never fade, get dirty, or wear out - it will last forever.<br /><br />Guinness has support from a female shop steward, but not her chief. He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich. But when he explains to them what he's done, they turn against him. If everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes! Soon Parkers' fellow textile tycoons (led by Gough, Ernest Theisinger - in a wonderful performance, and Howard Marion-Crawford) are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses. They seek to suppress the invention. With only Greenwood in his corner (although Parker sort of sympathizes with him), Guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public.<br /><br />In the end, Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed. But he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations, and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all.<br /><br />It's a brilliant comedy. But is the argument for suppression valid? At one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown (you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united. There is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat (or contract if the owner gets thin). Are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever? What happened to fashion changes and new styles? And the cloth is only made in the color white (making Guinness look like a white knight). We are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process. Wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile? <br /><br />Alas this is not a science paper, but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry. As such it is brilliant.

"I agree with the previous comment in naming the film's content ""everyday madness"" but would like to specify that: ""Dog Days"" is about how women are treated in (a male) society. The episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age group. There is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had, treating her like a doll that shall act ""worthy of wearing"" the former's dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a (violent) master. Further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend/wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor(s). A young adult man makes clear to his friend - a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him - that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette. Finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simple-minded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who - taking her for guilty in having scratched his car - natural beats her up. To complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the ""master-slave""-couple - after collectively abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former ""in her sake"" for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new ""master"".

"ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score . It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is <br /><br />ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career",1,road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newmans score   its haunting and beautiful but youre aware that this music is similar to newmans other work and while listening to the soundtrack youre reminded of scent of a woman   meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption youre reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen   as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway   irish gangsters is millers crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leones gangster epics  despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldnt be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed   but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you cant help thinking what a superb director mendes is  road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances   ive never been all that keen on tom hanks but hes every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role   probably better   paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent   newmans performance works due to the subtle body language   his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top   while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadnt decided to become james bond   a role which heralds the end of an actors career
"I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time, but he changed my views. I enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since. I even bought several of his CD's. Who cares what his acting abilities were, he basically just played himself, which was adorable. He was so charming, so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly. It was so straight, did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. He will definitely be missed!!!",1,i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago  i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time  but he changed my views  i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since  i even bought several of his cds  who cares what his acting abilities were  he basically just played himself  which was adorable  he was so charming  so charismatic  i honestly just wanted to hug him  i feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly  it was so straight  did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions  he deserves to be respected and admired for his talent  he will definitely be missed   
"""An album of songs so old everyone thinks they're new."" This film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments. And why not? Towering talent from Dame Judith Dench as a widow who plays saxaphone with a street musician to help him get the songs right, to Olympia Dukakis as the merry widow living in a Scottish castle on the alimony of her many marriages, to Ian Holm as the drummer who loved all the members of a World War II all girl (more or less) swing band. But wait, there's more. Add in Leslie Caron on bass, and the incomparable Clio Laine on lead vocal, at last, and the Blonde Bombshells are the hottest band in England since the Beatles. Well, OK, not really, but this movie is a winner.<br /><br />Elizabeth (Dench) spends the whole film trying to reunite the Blonde Bombshells to play at her granddaughter's school dance. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a bunch of sexegenarian women to step onstage in front of the Britney Spears generation following an act called ""Open Wound.""<br /><br />In an age when actresses careers are over by the time they're 30, most bands' second album is a greatest hits compilation, and music more than a month old has almost no chance of airplay, it's great to see real talent, real music and a really good movie come from, where else, the BBC.<br /><br />I love this movie, and I know I'll watch it many more times, and enjoy it more each time.",1, an album of songs so old everyone thinks theyre new   this film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments  and why not  towering talent from dame judith dench as a widow who plays saxaphone with a street musician to help him get the songs right  to olympia dukakis as the merry widow living in a scottish castle on the alimony of her many marriages  to ian holm as the drummer who loved all the members of a world war ii all girl  more or less  swing band  but wait  theres more  add in leslie caron on bass  and the incomparable clio laine on lead vocal  at last  and the blonde bombshells are the hottest band in england since the beatles  well  ok  not really  but this movie is a winner  elizabeth  dench  spends the whole film trying to reunite the blonde bombshells to play at her granddaughters school dance  and before you roll your eyes  imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a bunch of sexegenarian women to step onstage in front of the britney spears generation following an act called  open wound   in an age when actresses careers are over by the time theyre 30  most bands second album is a greatest hits compilation  and music more than a month old has almost no chance of airplay  its great to see real talent  real music and a really good movie come from  where else  the bbc  i love this movie  and i know ill watch it many more times  and enjoy it more each time 
"The 700 Club gives a great perspective on world events. Some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy. I find the program to be informative and inspirational. It is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful. There are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and The 700 Club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated, I find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism. I have certainly said some foolish things in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he puts out a great show.",1,the 700 club gives a great perspective on world events  some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy  i find the program to be informative and inspirational  it is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful  there are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them  while mr  robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated  i find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism  i have certainly said some foolish things in my life  i would certainly be willing to forgive mr  robertson since he puts out a great show 
"""Margaritas and Cock...""<br /><br />This tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs, surprises and unexpectedly touching moments. I had more fun watching ""The Matador"" than almost any other film from 2005. It is a wacky film with an unforgettable character, played to perfection by Pierce Brosnan.<br /><br />Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate gigs (assassinating rich dudes). He is also experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis. After coming to realization that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and runs into Danny Wright (Kinnear).<br /><br />Danny is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him. He loves his wife dearly, especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier.<br /><br />The two men are chalk and cheese, hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night. And somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever.<br /><br />The friendship they form reminded me a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble. The interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned, due in no small part to the wonderful performances from Brosnan and Kinnear.<br /><br />But make no mistake... This is Brosnan's film. He imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade. He could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him. Brosnan may be cinema's ultimate charmer, but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date. I wouldn't be averse to seeing an Oscar nod for this role.<br /><br />Consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high-school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line, ""All blushy blushy... No sucky fucky"". He does it with the familiar Bond smirk and manages to get away with it. He manages to tell a young boy, ""Tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years. Then get back to me"" without coming across as unlikable. In fact, it makes us like him even more.<br /><br />And yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes, most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns. However, when Julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console each other in their bedroom one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion.<br /><br />""The Matador"" is stylish and energetic. It is constantly entertaining. And it contains a career-defining role for Brosnan as the lonely hit-man looking for normalcy, friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life. This is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible.<br /><br />TC Candler of IndependentCritics.com",1, margaritas and cock     this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs  surprises and unexpectedly touching moments  i had more fun watching  the matador  than almost any other film from 2005  it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character  played to perfection by pierce brosnan  julian noble  brosnan  is a facilitator  hit man  who specializes in high end corporate gigs  assassinating rich dudes   he is also experiencing something akin to a mid life crisis  after coming to realization that he has no real friends  no permanent home and no planned future  he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright  kinnear   danny is a down on his luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him  he loves his wife dearly  especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier  the two men are chalk and cheese  hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night  and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever  the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy  one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble  the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned  due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnear  but make no mistake    this is brosnans film  he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade  he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and youd probably forgive him  brosnan may be cinemas ultimate charmer  but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date  i wouldnt be averse to seeing an oscar nod for this role  consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line   all blushy blushy    no sucky fucky   he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it  he manages to tell a young boy   tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years  then get back to me  without coming across as unlikable  in fact  it makes us like him even more  and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes  most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns  however  when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday  or when danny and his wife  davis  console each other in their bedroom one night  the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion   the matador  is stylish and energetic  it is constantly entertaining  and it contains a career defining role for brosnan as the lonely hit man looking for normalcy  friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life  this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible  tc candler of independentcritics com
"You cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed. That's why movies like Fast and the Furious, Dhoom, Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences, especially local ones. We live on a tiny island, and I cannot fathom why, for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system, most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100% tax when they reach our shores, and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one. Not only that, the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear, lest they reach the sea.<br /><br />And these movies are relatively easy to make. Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic. For once, those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long, can't compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these. Of course there are amongst us (ahem) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects (otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models, and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame), however, they don't warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen, even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park. The guy sitting beside me, I swear he wet his pants every time his dream car(s) appear, and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans.<br /><br />So there we have it, the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie. With the Fast and the Furious franchise, the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage, as does the GT. Here, the Ford GT takes on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification, that even I'm impressed, alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos, Porshe Carerra GTs, Koenigsegg CCXs, and every car out there that has wings for doors. But seriously, my heart goes out to the cars each time they're mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment. I mean, this are perfectly fine, high performance models that are at the apex of motoring, but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow, they do so because they can,<br /><br />There's no story in Redline, just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties (the cars that is) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible, and with the usual shots of pedals (always the accelerator, mind you, tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy, and earn you no respect), steering wheels, gear shifts (always shifting up and not down), all these while having the actors make pretend that they're the baddest asses with an engine, snarling and giving each other dirty looks. Not a very tall order for an actor, and that's why we get the most woeful performances ever, with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids.<br /><br />The heroine (yes, it made a statement that girls can drive) Natasha (a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin) is one of those million dollar finds - a girl with model looks who don't mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil, who has racing pedigree within her, and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable (every line had to do with cars, and when singing about love, just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts, lubricants and going for rides). Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous (Eddie Griffin), she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran, and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle. Everything else, well like I said, just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.<br /><br />And it's almost always the same, as there's very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars, especially when you know the race is rigged (for narrative reasons) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line. While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors, and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker, Sun Kang, and of course, the star it created - Vin Diesel, Redline had none, just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately. It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go, with a very insipid opening sequence where it's one man, one car, and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas.<br /><br />If not for the cars, then this movie seriously is a piece of junk, with bad acting, bad lines and bad action. Strictly for the car fans, or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines.",0,you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed  thats why movies like fast and the furious  dhoom  rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences  especially local ones  we live on a tiny island  and i cannot fathom why  for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system  most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100  tax when they reach our shores  and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one  not only that  the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear  lest they reach the sea  and these movies are relatively easy to make  hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic  for once  those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long  cant compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these  of course there are amongst us  ahem  those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects  otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models  and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame   however  they dont warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen  even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park  the guy sitting beside me  i swear he wet his pants every time his dream car s  appear  and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans  so there we have it  the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie  with the fast and the furious franchise  the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage  as does the gt  here  the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool worthy facade modification  that even im impressed  alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos  porshe carerra gts  koenigsegg ccxs  and every car out there that has wings for doors  but seriously  my heart goes out to the cars each time theyre mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment  i mean  this are perfectly fine  high performance models that are at the apex of motoring  but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow  they do so because they can  theres no story in redline  just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties  the cars that is  that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible  and with the usual shots of pedals  always the accelerator  mind you  tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy  and earn you no respect   steering wheels  gear shifts  always shifting up and not down   all these while having the actors make pretend that theyre the baddest asses with an engine  snarling and giving each other dirty looks  not a very tall order for an actor  and thats why we get the most woeful performances ever  with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids  the heroine  yes  it made a statement that girls can drive  natasha  a very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin  is one of those million dollar finds   a girl with model looks who dont mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil  who has racing pedigree within her  and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable  every line had to do with cars  and when singing about love  just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts  lubricants and going for rides   introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called infamous  eddie griffin   she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran  and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle  everything else  well like i said  just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race  and its almost always the same  as theres very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars  especially when you know the race is rigged  for narrative reasons  and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line  while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors  and i will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker  sun kang  and of course  the star it created   vin diesel  redline had none  just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately  it looks like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go  with a very insipid opening sequence where its one man  one car  and a 105 minutes race against time to get to vegas  if not for the cars  then this movie seriously is a piece of junk  with bad acting  bad lines and bad action  strictly for the car fans  or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines 
"This film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in Math. He didn't make the best experiences in life before and got serious self-esteem issues. After a rough start at his new school, he starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff.<br /><br />Beside some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way, focussing on Benjamin and his problems.<br /><br />If you already don't like this story outline, save your time and watch something else. If you do, please be aware of the following:<br /><br />1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self-pity all the time. For me he wasn't that kind of ""charming loser"" who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with. Instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind I could barely stand watching.<br /><br />2) The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren't (except for Janosch maybe). And yes, I know this film is based on an auto-biography written by a 17-year old - but having some experiences with German schools and German youth myself, I don't believe him.<br /><br />3) Showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys do an ""Ejaculate on the cookie""-contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass-masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm-wet cookie afterwards. Although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way, it's nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film.<br /><br />4) There's a sub-plot about Benjamin's family and his father betraying his wife - still, I don't know why it's there and where to put it. It just bored me.<br /><br />Well, I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin, being without a message, concept, scheme, whatever and it's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can image that some people may find it sensible and touching. If you liked ""The Other Sister"" you'll probably like this one, too. I hated both.<br /><br />17-year old boys shouldn't write an autobiography and if they do, it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it.<br /><br />2 out of 10.",0,this film is a portrait of the half spastic teenage boy benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in math  he didnt make the best experiences in life before and got serious self esteem issues  after a rough start at his new school  he starts making friends  falls in love with a girl and does some american pieish teenage stuff  beside some comedy elements  the film is told in a very serious way  focussing on benjamin and his problems  if you already dont like this story outline  save your time and watch something else  if you do  please be aware of the following  1  benjamin is a total loser  whatever he does  he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self pity all the time  for me he wasnt that kind of  charming loser  who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with  instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind i could barely stand watching  2  the film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just arent  except for janosch maybe   and yes  i know this film is based on an auto biography written by a 17 year old   but having some experiences with german schools and german youth myself  i dont believe him  3  showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject  but i doubt that teenage boys do an  ejaculate on the cookie  contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm wet cookie afterwards  although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way  its nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film  4  theres a sub plot about benjamins family and his father betraying his wife   still  i dont know why its there and where to put it  it just bored me  well  i personally hated this film for having the character of benjamin  being without a message  concept  scheme  whatever and its failing attempts to be dramatic and serious  however  i can image that some people may find it sensible and touching  if you liked  the other sister  youll probably like this one  too  i hated both  17 year old boys shouldnt write an autobiography and if they do  it doesnt seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it  2 out of 10

"I tried restarting the movie twice. I put it in three machines to see what was wrong. Did Steven Seagal's voice change? Did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesn't even resemble him? Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the actor's real voice. Though throughout most of the film, it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroom.<br /><br />I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill, if I owned a copy. I rented it, but I will never do that again. I will check this database before renting any more of his movies, all of which were (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you were getting when you watched a Steven Seagal movie. I guess that is no more.",0,i tried restarting the movie twice  i put it in three machines to see what was wrong  did steven seagals voice change  did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesnt even resemble him  or was the sound on the dvd destroyed  after about 10 minutes  you finally hear the actors real voice  though throughout most of the film  it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroom  i would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to goodwill  if i owned a copy  i rented it  but i will never do that again  i will check this database before renting any more of his movies  all of which were  more or less  good movies  you usually knew what you were getting when you watched a steven seagal movie  i guess that is no more

"Oh god, what a horrible, horrible film. Meant to be a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality TV. Interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most obnoxious part, written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful. Rather, these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting, condescending speech that shoves the ""meaning"" of the film down the viewer's throat.<br /><br />Also, a point to would-be filmmakers: Long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art. Neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity.<br /><br />If anyone out there is interested in watching this film, please don't. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.",0,oh god  what a horrible  horrible film  meant to be a comment on the state of society  its just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv  interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part  written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful  rather  these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting  condescending speech that shoves the  meaning  of the film down the viewers throat  also  a point to would be filmmakers  long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art  neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity  if anyone out there is interested in watching this film  please dont  seriously  please  you have better things to do 
"The basic storyline here is, Aditiya (Kumar) is the spoilt son of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan) who owns a toy industry, in Ishwar's eyes his son Aditya can do nothing wrong, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late, for Ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live, when his son elopes and marries Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar readily forgives Aditya, but when the happy couple Aditya and Mitali come back from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant, and this forces Ishwar to kick Aditya out of the house to make him more responsible, Aditya doesn't know his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he also doesn't know that his father has kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible, Ishwar cannot bring himself to tall Aditya that he is about to die, with a hungry and pregnant wife. it is a race against time so Aditya does all he can to prove himself to his father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die.<br /><br />This movie is absolutely brilliant, this is the breakthrough in Indian cinema that was needed for the Bollywood industry, Shah's directing is almost flawless, but which movie doesn't have flaws? The best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker. the song interludes is just placed at the right time, the scenery is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying, but overall this is a brilliant movie, i advise anybody Reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews. 9/10",1,the basic storyline here is  aditiya  kumar  is the spoilt son of a millionaire  ishwar  bachan  who owns a toy industry  in ishwars eyes his son aditya can do nothing wrong  adityas mother sumitra  shefali shah  warns ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late  for ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live  when his son elopes and marries mitali  chopra   ishwar readily forgives aditya  but when the happy couple aditya and mitali come back from a honeymoon  mitali is pregnant  and this forces ishwar to kick aditya out of the house to make him more responsible  aditya doesnt know his father is suffering from lung cancer  and he also doesnt know that his father has kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible  ishwar cannot bring himself to tall aditya that he is about to die  with a hungry and pregnant wife  it is a race against time so aditya does all he can to prove himself to his father  and the climax comes when aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die  this movie is absolutely brilliant  this is the breakthrough in indian cinema that was needed for the bollywood industry  shahs directing is almost flawless  but which movie doesnt have flaws  the best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker  the song interludes is just placed at the right time  the scenery is good  the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between boman irani and rajpal yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying  but overall this is a brilliant movie  i advise anybody reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews  9 10
"And I thought The Beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Don't blame him for the awful script, if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie, give your self a pat on the back. Its a cross between The Village and a crappier script. Its starts off kinda catching your eye, and then as it goes further into the plot, it just makes no sense, and don't get me started about the ending!!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations.

Granted, movies don't always have to have deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still film-makers out there who care about telling ""human"" stories. I won't give away the premise of this brilliant film, however, the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones I have ever seen in my life, and I'm a 32-year-old film buff too!

"I think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really, really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn't live up to the trailer. It's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love/hate relationship with this movie.<br /><br />However, if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast, i think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she's so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else, she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled coworkers, his elegant mother-in-law, his fratlike friend Jim and his bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make Stiles stand out in the first place. <br /><br />Lee doesn't live up to his costars, i don't think, but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to. Maybe that's one source of disappointment.<br /><br />The movie itself, despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the writer's intended, is still pretty funny and I found a rather intelligent film. The themes of conformity and ""taking the safe route"" seemed to cleverly align on several layers. For example, there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene, or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms, or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice.<br /><br />The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck (example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef) and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part.<br /><br />While it wasn't as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent, but overall it's still a good movie.",1,i think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really  really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesnt live up to the trailer  its a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise  and i think im seeing from the comments people having a love hate relationship with this movie  however  if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast  i think its still pretty good  julia stiles is clearly the star  shes so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else  she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee  the rest of the cast  of course  lees testosterone filled coworkers  his elegant mother in law  his fratlike friend jim and his bride to be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make stiles stand out in the first place   lee doesnt live up to his costars  i dont think  but you could view that as more that theyre hard to live up to  maybe thats one source of disappointment  the movie itself  despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that dont come off as funny as the writers intended  is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film  the themes of conformity and  taking the safe route  seemed to cleverly align on several layers  for example  there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene  or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms  or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice  the other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck  example  the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef  and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part  while it wasnt as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent  but overall its still a good movie

"Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs.

The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat. And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry.

"Unless you are petrified of Russian people or boars, this movie is a snorefest. Actually, I fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater. I wish I had.

"Made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often.<br /><br />We open on a quiet little French village, scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. Upon investigating the uproar, two neighboring men are told the story of two men, supposedly friends, who picked two numbers for the lottery.<br /><br />Our star of the picture has his number and his friend his. When he asks his friend, would he share half of the dough, should his ticket be the winning number, his friend promptly says no. In fact, H.E. double hockey sticks no! is the way he acts about it.<br /><br />So when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost, through no fault of his own, he is frantic. Everyone is out for themselves, looking for this ticket, in something like a precursor to ""The Great Race.""

"It's a testament to Gosha's incredible film-making prowess that he was able to complete both Hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece, Goyokin, in the same year, 1969. And it's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public (compared to media darlings like the great Akira Kurosawa), that both Hitokiri and Goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them.<br /><br />Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo: mad dog killer, loyal to the Tosha clan and their boss Takechi, played by another genre stalwart, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the flailing Shogunate. The historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with Japan's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the Tokugawa and the pressure by the West to end a 300 year social and political seclusion. It helps a lot to know a thing or two about Japanese history and what eventually led to the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Tokugawa Shogunate, but it's not essential by any means. The movie was made primarily for a Japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well.<br /><br />As one would expect from a Hideo Gosha film in his golden years (the late 60's) the visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty. Style however is never decorative for Gosha - it is always employed in the service of story. <br /><br />And speaking of story, Hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character Izo Okada. As most chambara protagonists, Izo finds himself in a moral double-bind, torn between giri (obligation) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is. In the first half of the movie Izo is trying for social self-advancement. Lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century Japan. <br /><br />The turning point for Izo is when he realizes at what cost self-advancement comes, the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self. It is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the Tosha Clan to a ""nameless"" drifter without past or future, Torazo the Vagrant. Although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in Yojimbo's mold, it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego, ambition and self-dillusion that allows Izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself. <br /><br />Hitokiri ends (which I won't reveal here) in the best way any story can end: both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives Izo the last laugh, a last sardonic remark in the face of death.",1,its a testament to goshas incredible film making prowess that he was able to complete both hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece  goyokin  in the same year  1969  and its a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public  compared to media darlings like the great akira kurosawa   that both hitokiri and goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them  shintaro katsu is okada izo  mad dog killer  loyal to the tosha clan and their boss takechi  played by another genre stalwart  tatsuya nakadai  the tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the flailing shogunate  the historical backdrop is fairly accurate   with japans increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the tokugawa and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political seclusion  it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the meiji restoration and the abolition of the tokugawa shogunate  but its not essential by any means  the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well  as one would expect from a hideo gosha film in his golden years  the late 60s  the visual palette is breathtaking  the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty  style however is never decorative for gosha   it is always employed in the service of story   and speaking of story  hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character izo okada  as most chambara protagonists  izo finds himself in a moral double bind  torn between giri  obligation  and ninjo  natural impulse    although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is  in the first half of the movie izo is trying for social self advancement  lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrats daughter   a great progression for someone coming from a farmers background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century japan   the turning point for izo is when he realizes at what cost self advancement comes  the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self  it is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the tosha clan to a  nameless  drifter without past or future  torazo the vagrant  although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in yojimbos mold  it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego  ambition and self dillusion that allows izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself   hitokiri ends  which i wont reveal here  in the best way any story can end  both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives izo the last laugh  a last sardonic remark in the face of death

Nice story, funny riches-to-rags situations, Mel Brooks is not a bad lead, maybe not perfect but he is funny ;D Don't pay attention to the rating, it's BS. Watch it, then watch something like final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves about the same rating.

"To quote the film, ""It's better not to know. Better still to forget. Best of all to be abandoned."" Oh, the irony.<br /><br />A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror film, but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film, and you feel like you're being preached to from the start.<br /><br />It's as if the writers' cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop TV and a Jerry Springer show. Fitting, maybe, for a film like The Hitcher, not a Russia-set horror film. The result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly, not scary or meaningful.",0,to quote the film   its better not to know  better still to forget  best of all to be abandoned   oh  the irony  a ghost story with all the technical refinements of a hollywood horror film  but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film  and you feel like youre being preached to from the start  its as if the writers cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop tv and a jerry springer show  fitting  maybe  for a film like the hitcher  not a russia set horror film  the result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly  not scary or meaningful

"I have always enjoyed the Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, all of them are very corny, mediocre in some certain areas and sure, even though they're aimed at little kids they're too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement,""Hey, lighten up, it's a kids movie,"" but all that aside, aren't they still good pieces of entertainment? In my opinion, they are so and I enjoy them greatly. This one is just as enjoyable as the previous three, and certainly cuter. It has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable, fresh Pokemon Celebi. It's not the best Pokemon movie, but I do enjoy it more than the third installment, even though the third is not bad, and the entire series is just entertaining, harmless, popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more, nothing less. This film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially around the climax/ending, as do all the installments, and the characters, while a bit more lackluster than the previous three, I thought, are still likable and humorous. This films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length adaptions, and it doesn't deserve that.",1,i have always enjoyed the pokemon movies  yes  i know  all of them are very corny  mediocre in some certain areas and sure  even though theyre aimed at little kids theyre too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement  hey  lighten up  its a kids movie   but all that aside  arent they still good pieces of entertainment  in my opinion  they are so and i enjoy them greatly  this one is just as enjoyable as the previous three  and certainly cuter  it has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable  fresh pokemon celebi  its not the best pokemon movie  but i do enjoy it more than the third installment  even though the third is not bad  and the entire series is just entertaining  harmless  popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more  nothing less  this film has some high marks of intensity and interest  especially around the climax ending  as do all the installments  and the characters  while a bit more lackluster than the previous three  i thought  are still likable and humorous  this films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length adaptions  and it doesnt deserve that 
"Mislead by the terrible lie on the cover, ""fun as American Pie"", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy... and this is definitely not one. You probably won't laugh one time if you're not one of those Jackass-like ever-teeny minds. It's not even an erotic movie, which would at least been something, given that it's about sex...<br /><br />So, what is this? The erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, I remember ""Losing it"" for one) and his gang of friends. The rest of the characters (i.e. the girls) just come and go for no credible reason. Come on, there are even Dwarfs (so simple: ""dwarves are fun ho ho""...) The acting is very TV-like (as is the video look throughout the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls...<br /><br />Awful movie. Amateurish, badly produced, and over all NOT FUNNY. Kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes.

"By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over, as films were moving in a different direction, comedically and otherwise. With television looming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. Where, one wonders, would movies have gone had television not come along, or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years? Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed.<br /><br />Ad man Jim Blandings, along with his wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment, as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs. So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications. Well, almost. Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind. Then again he might not have. You decide. On this frail premise a wonderful film results, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one. Nothing comes easy in this life, as Mr. Blandings learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way. There is, after all, the long run. But, Blandings asks himself every few minutes, how long is long?<br /><br />This movie is a delight. It is not, I suppose, a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically. There is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of (W.C.) Fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically, but not so much as to leave a bad taste. The people in the film are all very smart and affluent, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class.<br /><br />Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs. Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics, such as how the real world works. There is, too, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place. These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut. In a few short years things would change, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns, which soon would be connected by highways, littered with bottles and cans, their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city.",1,by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over  as films were moving in a different direction  comedically and otherwise  with television looming on the horizon  hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time  where  one wonders  would movies have gone had television not come along  or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years  mr  blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed  ad man jim blandings  along with his wife and two daughters  are living in a nice but way too cramped new york city apartment  as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs  so he buys some property in connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications  well  almost  had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind  then again he might not have  you decide  on this frail premise a wonderful film results  full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning ones own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one  nothing comes easy in this life  as mr  blandings learns  but one neednt be miserable just because things dont always go ones way  there is  after all  the long run  but  blandings asks himself every few minutes  how long is long  this movie is a delight  it is not  i suppose  a masterpiece in the capra mccarey tradition  but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures  and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically  there is real warmth in the picture  and a good deal of  w c   fieldsian hard edged reality obtruding periodically  but not so much as to leave a bad taste  the people in the film are all very smart and affluent  but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class  lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr  and mrs  blandings to perfection  while melvyn douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend  who often has to bring up unpleasant topics  such as how the real world works  there is  too  a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia  which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years  as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place  these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural connecticut  in a few short years things would change  as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear  destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns  which soon would be connected by highways  littered with bottles and cans  their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city 
"Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on TV now. The way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today's shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side. The way mark's brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking, and if you think you do, you are wrong.<br /><br />Diagnosis Murder has tackled a diverse range of topics, not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives. Everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology.<br /><br />As for it being for old people? I am 24!! I don't think i can be classed as old yet.<br /><br />I just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so that i can watch them all in order.

"this is a wonderful film, makes the 1950'S look beautifully stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern-day witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All the supporting performances are terrific, from Jack Lemmon as her bother Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico who is working on Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy Aunt Queenie. And then there is the cat- I have no idea how many witches (besides me) have named a cat Pyewacket but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only just as much as his character is out of p;ace in this weird sub-world of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it has the perfect romantic happy ending, which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings. Gillian and Shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another great film)",1,this is a wonderful film  makes the 1950s look beautifully stylish  kim novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern day witch with one foot in manhattan and another in infinity  all the supporting performances are terrific  from jack lemmon as her bother nicky to ernie kovacs as the author of magic in mexico who is working on magic in manghattan  to elsa lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy aunt queenie  and then there is the cat  i have no idea how many witches  besides me  have named a cat pyewacket but suggest a zillion  jmes stewart looks out of place  but only just as much as his character is out of p ace in this weird sub world of magic and witchcraft  perfect  and it has the perfect romantic happy ending  which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings  gillian and shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as rose and charlie allnut in the african queen  another great film

"I used to write comments at IMDb, but I don't do so anymore. It happens that IMDb has become massive, and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores. What do I mean? That anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and doesn't have any expertise on the subject, watches some crap (or the opposite), and in case he likes it, delivers a 10, and if he doesn't he goes for a 1. This of course, cannot measure anything correctly. Now for the film. I truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films, because then I must score this one with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something that I don't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film. It is simply mesmerizing, and it's not just a way of saying; it really is. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys-, that really... there's no possible match.

"Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid. Beauteous Russ Meyer starlet Eric (""Vixen,"" ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"") Gavin gives a robust, winning performance as a brassy, resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy, hellish penitentiary. The always fabulous Barbara Steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean, crippled, sexually frustrated warden (her erotic dream about doing a slow, steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly). Longtime favorite 70's B-movie actress Roberta (""The Arousers,"" ""Unholy Rollers"") Collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward, foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about Pinnochio. Lynda Gold (a.k.a. Crystin Sinclaire of Tobe Hooper's ""Eaten Alive"" and Curtis Harrington's ""Ruby"") makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat Crazy Alice. And the ever-cuddly Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith does a lovely, touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from ""Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural."" <br /><br />Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language, nudity, rape and violence, it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force. Demme's zesty, confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior. Furthermore, both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and John Cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100% on the money excellent. Patrick Wright (Sheriff Mack in the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler ""Track of the Moonbeast"") has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom.

Bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, poor script, generally bad acting all add up to make this ""film"" unwatchable.

"Unhinged was part of the Video Nasty censorship film selection that the UK built up in the 80's. Keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children, don't you know! It must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about. By today's standard, Unhinged is a tame little fairy tale.<br /><br />3 girls are off to a jazz concert... and right away, you know the body count is going to be quite low. They get lost in the woods, & wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it's laughable. They are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house. One of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs. Then there's talking. Talking about why the girls are here, and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesn't like it when someone is late. And more talking. Yakkity yak. Some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls, and someone's eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like Hitchcock's Psycho. I digress because there is so much blah blah in this film, that you wonder when the killings are going to start. In fact, one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods, alone, looking for the town. Smart move. She probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part, but just didn't care. More talk continues after this as we wait, wait, and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed.<br /><br />And then there's the twist ending. The ""expected"" unexpected for some viewers, for others a real gotcha. Quite possibly the ONLY reason why someone would really want to watch this. I don't care how twisted it is, nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time I had watching it. Even with the minor impact of the ending, the director just didn't have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it. It would have made a much better 30 minute - 1 hour TV episode on say, Tales from the Darkside.<br /><br />If you really must get this for any reason, perhaps just to say you've watched every slasher movie, do yourself a favor and have the fast-forward button ready. Since the movie has so many unimportant scenes, just zoom through them, and in no time, you'll get to the ""WOW, that's what it was all this time"" ending.

Those beautiful buzzing honey-making boo-bees.",0,unhinged was part of the video nasty censorship film selection that the uk built up in the 80s  keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children  dont you know  it must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about  by todays standard  unhinged is a tame little fairy tale  3 girls are off to a jazz concert    and right away  you know the body count is going to be quite low  they get lost in the woods    wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake its laughable  they are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house  one of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs  then theres talking  talking about why the girls are here  and how they must be to dinner on time because mother doesnt like it when someone is late  and more talking  yakkity yak  some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls  and someones eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like hitchcocks psycho  i digress because there is so much blah blah in this film  that you wonder when the killings are going to start  in fact  one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods  alone  looking for the town  smart move  she probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part  but just didnt care  more talk continues after this as we wait  wait  and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed  and then theres the twist ending  the  expected  unexpected for some viewers  for others a real gotcha  quite possibly the only reason why someone would really want to watch this  i dont care how twisted it is  nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time i had watching it  even with the minor impact of the ending  the director just didnt have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it  it would have made a much better 30 minute   1 hour tv episode on say  tales from the darkside  if you really must get this for any reason  perhaps just to say youve watched every slasher movie  do yourself a favor and have the fast forward button ready  since the movie has so many unimportant scenes  just zoom through them  and in no time  youll get to the  wow  thats what it was all this time  ending  oh and halfway through the movie theres a shower scene with 2 girls showing boo bees  horray for boo bees  those beautiful buzzing honey making boo bees 
"Horror Gods Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any Genre-lover to watch a film, and, even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little Sci-Fi/Horror gem. While Lambert Hillyer's ""The Invisible Ray"" of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring Karloff (""Frankenstein, ""Bride Of Frankenstein"", ""The Mummy"",...) or Lugosi (""White Zombie"", ""Island Of The Lost Souls"", ""Dracula"",...), or both (""The Black Cat"", ""The Raven"",...), this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing. Compared to other Universal Horror pictures, the storyline seems a bit silly, but in a delightful manner. Karloff and Lugosi, of course, shine as always, and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography. Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope, and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago. Stunned by Rukh's invention, the celebrated French scientist Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor. In Africa, Rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike... It is somewhat odd that Karloff, who was in fact British, plays a Hungarian scientist here while Lugosi, who was Hungarian, plays a French Scientist, but they are both excellent as usual. As far as I am concerned, these two Horror Deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory, and I am sure they would have made something out of it - either man is an icon of the Horror genre, and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre. By the way, this is one of the few films, if not the only one, in which it is obvious that Lugosi was actually taller than Karloff. Frances Drake makes a very good female lead in her role of Dr Rukh's beautiful young wife. The rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning. Other than the casting of Karloff and Lugosi, the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline. My main complaint is that I would have wished for more screen time for Lugosi, and for his role to have a bit more significance. He is fantastic as always, but his role could have been bigger, and more sinister. Otherwise, ""The Invisible Ray"" is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic Horror/Sci-Fi cinema, and a must-see for all my fellow Lugosi/Karloff fans.",1,horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre lover to watch a film  and  even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci fi horror gem  while lambert hillyers  the invisible ray  of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff   frankenstein   bride of frankenstein    the mummy       or lugosi   white zombie    island of the lost souls    dracula        or both   the black cat    the raven        this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing  compared to other universal horror pictures  the storyline seems a bit silly  but in a delightful manner  karloff and lugosi  of course  shine as always  and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography  karloff plays dr  janos rukh  a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope  and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago  stunned by rukhs invention  the celebrated french scientist dr  felix benet  bela lugosi   invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor  in africa  rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike    it is somewhat odd that karloff  who was in fact british  plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi  who was hungarian  plays a french scientist  but they are both excellent as usual  as far as i am concerned  these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory  and i am sure they would have made something out of it   either man is an icon of the horror genre  and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre  by the way  this is one of the few films  if not the only one  in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff  frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukhs beautiful young wife  the rest of the performances are also good  if not particularly worth mentioning  other than the casting of karloff and lugosi  the films greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography  as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline  my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi  and for his role to have a bit more significance  he is fantastic as always  but his role could have been bigger  and more sinister  otherwise   the invisible ray  is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror sci fi cinema  and a must see for all my fellow lugosi karloff fans

"To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made.<br /><br />From beginning to end it oozes class. It is stimulating, thought provoking, a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples.<br /><br />The cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and Technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly. The characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy.<br /><br />No matter how many times I watch the film - and I have watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It is as fresh today as it was in 1946.<br /><br />If I were allowed just one film to keep and watch again A Matter of Life and Death would be that film.",1,to me a matter of life and death is just that  simply the best film ever made  from beginning to end it oozes class  it is stimulating  thought provoking  a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples  the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly  the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy  no matter how many times i watch the film   and i have watched it a lot   it never fails to touch me  it makes me smile  it makes me laugh  it makes me think  it makes me cry  it is as fresh today as it was in 1946  if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film

"Well after three times through I still have no idea what this movie is about because, quite honestly, it failed to generate any real interest or concern. But here it goes: A bunch of too old to be teen Teen Actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980's fashions (did WE look like that too??) decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned Alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off POLTERGEIST, THE EVIL DEAD, and Freddy Kreuger in one fell swoop. The dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin. Good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt, and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget. Mine are usually pretty lame: Girls, model space ships, blowing things up with a bazooka, etc.<br /><br />Once on the Alcatraz island they find themselves in a Slasher movie, and meet up with Tony Basil, who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew (complete with a smoke machine for that 1980's smoky haze infused light look, which I kind of miss). And such reminded me that Ms. Basil helped choreograph David Byrne of the Talking Heads for some of his videos and performances. This of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about. It sort of happens, and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the TV set off to the side. But since the film isn't really interesting, you'll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time, the movie will keep ending, and you'll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again, dammit ...<br /><br />*SOME* 1980's Teen Horror movies can survive such specialized viewing: Umberto Lenzi's GHOSTHOUSE, CHOPPING MALL & it's Killbots, the hard to ignore NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and the over-the-top SLEEPAWAY CAMP all come to mind. They are films that, like them or not, demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or T&A, and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the TV instead of your keyboard. I am sure that HELL ISLAND (as the British version I glommed onto is titled) does indeed have some good stuff in there, but frankly I don't care. And nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesn't inspire admiration, some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it. The film is content with simpering away 80-whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance, but no dice.<br /><br />There is some offbeat production design going on, the use of lighting is striking at times, and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980's Teen Horror interested. The rest of you be warned though: YOU WILL WONDER IF YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT IN 1987, and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen. Try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren't stuck with the damn thing: Movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days, what with the world coming to an end & all ...",0,well after three times through i still have no idea what this movie is about because  quite honestly  it failed to generate any real interest or concern  but here it goes  a bunch of too old to be teen teen actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980s fashions  did we look like that too    decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off poltergeist  the evil dead  and freddy kreuger in one fell swoop  the dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin  good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt  and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget  mine are usually pretty lame  girls  model space ships  blowing things up with a bazooka  etc  once on the alcatraz island they find themselves in a slasher movie  and meet up with tony basil  who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew  complete with a smoke machine for that 1980s smoky haze infused light look  which i kind of miss   and such reminded me that ms  basil helped choreograph david byrne of the talking heads for some of his videos and performances  this of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about  it sort of happens  and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the tv set off to the side  but since the film isnt really interesting  youll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time  the movie will keep ending  and youll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again  dammit      some  1980s teen horror movies can survive such specialized viewing  umberto lenzis ghosthouse  chopping mall   its killbots  the hard to ignore night of the creeps and the over the top sleepaway camp all come to mind  they are films that  like them or not  demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or t a  and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the tv instead of your keyboard  i am sure that hell island  as the british version i glommed onto is titled  does indeed have some good stuff in there  but frankly i dont care  and nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesnt inspire admiration  some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it  the film is content with simpering away 80 whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance  but no dice  there is some offbeat production design going on  the use of lighting is striking at times  and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980s teen horror interested  the rest of you be warned though  you will wonder if you dressed like that in 1987  and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen  try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you arent stuck with the damn thing  movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days  what with the world coming to an end   all    
"Sure, for it's super imagery and awesome sound, it's a great home theater ""show off"" disk, but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. Young, old, boys and girls alike will find that deep down, we are all fans of the automobile, especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. The Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content.

"In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity skit show. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host. There are many reasons why I said that. Even though Hal Sparks was an okay host, I sometimes wish that Greg Kinnear hadn't left. If you ask me, it seems that nobody stays with a TV show throughout its entire run anymore. Still, I enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities. If you ask me, that was pretty darn funny. Before I wrap this up, I must say that I kind of miss this show.

"The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure. First and foremost, it is a good story. Though my four children's primary exposure to this tale, the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights, comes from the Disney Corporation, the Thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end. The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal, judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say, ""He's c-u-t-e!"" <br /><br />In 1940, the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, those effects seem very dated (""Look, it's Barbie flying through the air,"" declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying). Yet they fit into the story well. The film is, after all, over 60 years old. The effects fit with the script. Furthermore, what ones sees in The Thief of Bagdad remained pretty much state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years. One need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In that, it was quite an achievement.<br /><br />This qualifies as a family film, though there are a few stabbings near the end. The acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation.<br /><br />All in all, a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects.

"There's a lot going on in The College Girl Murders. A mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas. Before he can reap the rewards of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hooded, whip-welding monk. After a co-ed is killed in a church by the gas, Scotland Yard is called in to investigate, but the killing continues. Who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college? <br /><br />What Works: <br /><br />- The Killer. What's not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red KKK looking outfit, complete with red gloves. The white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown. Although the idea of a killer in a flaming red, pointy-head outfit sneaking around a girl's school is fairly far-fetched, it's one of the more sinister looking costumes I've seen.<br /><br />- Groovy 60s Music. I really would like to track down the title music to The College Girl Murders. It's got a jazzy, hip, 60s feel to it that I just loved.<br /><br />- Bizarre Touches. Beyond the killer's red gown and hood, the movie features a sliding fireplace, a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead, poison spraying bibles, a strategically placed mannequin, mini-skirts, go-go boots, and mile high hair. I would describe it as a cross between the 60s Batman TV show and an Italian giallo. The College Girl Murders is a real treat for the eye.<br /><br />- The End. Let's just say that there are more twists than a mountain road. Just when you think the killer has been uncovered, here comes a twist..and another.and anotherand another.<br /><br />What Doesn't Work: <br /><br />- Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the guy was meant to be comic relief, but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time.<br /><br />- Why Have Alligators? Previously, I mentioned the alligators in the pit. And while they are a nice touch, they serve very little purpose. Why go through all the trouble and not use them? <br /><br />- Plodding Plot. Some of The College Girl Murders has no flow or rhythm to it. There are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt.

This one has a real funky feel to it that I really go into.

"...Or, more precisely, so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it! James Sbardellati's ""Deathstalker"" of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the Sword & Sorcery sub-genre has brought along, but it is highly amusing. The acting is terrible, the plot is pure crap, and the effects and photography couldn't be more amateurish. But it is the bad acting, the cheesy effects, and the many errors, that makes this movie so hilarious.<br /><br />- SPOILERS AHEAD -<br /><br />Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a chalice, in order to free the country from its brutal ruler, the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. Obtaining the sword is quite easy, but the amulet and the chalice are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county's most skilled warriors fight each other until death. The winner is then to take the king's place. Of course, the king doesn't want anybody to take his place, an therefore he has planned to kill the winner (instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation, but also to save the old, good king's gorgeous daughter (Barbi Benton) from the claws of evil Munkar. Luckily, he doesn't get bored on his way to the tournament, since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) in the meantime...<br /><br />The film has many great, incredibly stupid and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /><br />- Deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls down, however, is not that guy's head. The falling head has a red goatee, while the guy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard.<br /><br />- When the character of female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is introduced, she is first seen in a black robe, hiding her face and body. Deathstalker's traveling companion Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights her, and during the sword fight her robe (under which she is, of course topless) opens, exposing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson, even before her face.<br /><br />- The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament, is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig.<br /><br />- Evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest. He feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers.<br /><br />... There are many other unintentionally funny, hilarious, and great scenes. The acting is terrible but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are eye-candy, and although I described this movie as 'unintentionally funny', I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is. There is a fair amount of gore, and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained. ""Deathstalker"" is an incredibly awful movie, but I still highly recommend it.

Actually, it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who did the voice for Frodo sounded somewhat like Elijah Wood.<br /><br />Not the greatest adaptation of a book, but trust me, I've seen a lot worse. It skips quite a lot of things, since both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into one two hour movie.

"I really enjoyed this film because I have a tremendous interest in American History... the Antebellum years and the Civil War in particular. I purchased it recently from a rack of previously-viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and I was very glad to add this one to my history video collection. Though not of the caliber of Civil War films such as ""Glory"" or ""Gettysburg,"" provides a lot of history on the pre-Civil War brotherhood among cadets at West Point.<br /><br />Maybe it's the gray uniforms, the youth, or the military discipline, but I am fascinated by the story of the Corps of Cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the War. I imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men, learning how to make war, then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates!<br /><br />Actually, there were two classes graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. the movie makes no real mention of this, except to mention Henry A. DuPont, first graduate of the May Class; and George Custer, last grad of the June Class. the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war, but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (I think the first class had attended five years, the other for four). As the movie portrays, cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other... George ""Fanny"" or ""Autie"" Custer; Alonzo ""Lon"" Cushing; James ""Beauty"" Stuart (for J.E.B. Stuart, class of 1854), etc.<br /><br />I say this film is ""Santa Fe Trail"" as it should have been because that 1940 film, while enjoyable, really fudges history. Cadets from several different classes are all graduating together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side-by-side in stopping John Brown's 1859 insurrection at Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the War. They faced each other (for the first time, I think) at Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was at the Harper's ferry Raid, but Custer was still a cadet at the Point when it took place).<br /><br />""Fanny"" Custer plays a role in ""Class of '61,"" though his classmate chums, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictional. I believe they are respectively based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can look up.<br /><br />Anyway, I truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid-19th Century America.",1,i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history    the antebellum years and the civil war in particular  i purchased it recently from a rack of previously viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection  though not of the caliber of civil war films such as  glory  or  gettysburg   provides a lot of history on the pre civil war brotherhood among cadets at west point  maybe its the gray uniforms  the youth  or the military discipline  but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the war  i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men  learning how to make war  then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates  actually  there were two classes graduated in 1861  one class in may  the other in june  the movie makes no real mention of this  except to mention henry a  dupont  first graduate of the may class  and george custer  last grad of the june class  the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war  but it was the result of switching back to a four year course of study  after a few years of experimenting with a five year course  i think the first class had attended five years  the other for four   as the movie portrays  cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other    george  fanny  or  autie  custer  alonzo  lon  cushing  james  beauty  stuart  for j e b  stuart  class of 1854   etc  i say this film is  santa fe trail  as it should have been because that 1940 film  while enjoyable  really fudges history  cadets from several different classes are all graduating together  jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side by side in stopping john browns 1859 insurrection at harpers ferry  in fact  stuart and custer were never friends  but enemies during the war  they faced each other  for the first time  i think  at gettysburg in 1863  stuart was at the harpers ferry raid  but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place    fanny  custer plays a role in  class of 61   though his classmate chums  dev oneill and shelby peyton are fictional  i believe they are respectively based on partick henry ororke and john pelham  two people you can look up  anyway  i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid 19th century america 
This is a wonderful film. The non-stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate. The musical productions of Busby Berkeley will never be duplicated. I think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together. Some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's movies. Put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is.,1,this is a wonderful film  the non stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate  the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated  i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts  joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together  some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of todays movies  put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is 
"There is no possible reason I can fathom why this movie was ever made.<br /><br />Why must Hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another? ( Cases in point: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - awful! )<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd, whom I normally enjoy, was so miserably miscast in this role. His manic portrayal of our beloved ""Uncle Martin"" is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal. His ranting, groaning, grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character.<br /><br />The director must have thought that fast movements, screaming dialogue and ""one-take"" slapstick had some similarity to comedy. Apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they had red ants in their pants.<br /><br />Fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script. I think the writer used ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" as an example of a fine comedy script. As manic as that 1963 classic is, it is far superior to this claptrap - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison.<br /><br />What is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children. I just am not sure whose children it was made for. Certainly no self-respecting, card-carrying child I know!<br /><br />If they HAD to remake ""My Favorite Martian"", why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic? <br /><br />Unfortunately, IMDB.com cannot factor in ""zero"" as a rating for its readers, that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty.<br /><br />One good thing did come from this movie, the actors and crew were paid - I think.",0,there is no possible reason i can fathom why this movie was ever made  why must hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another    cases in point  mister magoo  the avengers   awful    christopher lloyd  whom i normally enjoy  was so miserably miscast in this role  his manic portrayal of our beloved  uncle martin  is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal  his ranting  groaning  grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character  the director must have thought that fast movements  screaming dialogue and  one take  slapstick had some similarity to comedy  apparently he told every actor to act as if they had red ants in their pants  fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script  i think the writer used  its a mad  mad  mad  mad world  as an example of a fine comedy script  as manic as that 1963 classic is  it is far superior to this claptrap   in fact   suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison  what is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children  i just am not sure whose children it was made for  certainly no self respecting  card carrying child i know  if they had to remake  my favorite martian   why didnt they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic   unfortunately  imdb com cannot factor in  zero  as a rating for its readers  that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty  one good thing did come from this movie  the actors and crew were paid   i think 
"Extremely dull drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, the Flicka of the title, and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place.

"*May contain spoilers*<br /><br />I bent over backwards to be fair to this film. I knew it starred Madonna. I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters. I knew it got a lot of bad reviews. I wasn't expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class, culture and sexuality like we got in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes.<br /><br />Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, nit-witted Gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends (the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the ship's first-mate who the Madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together. Why is she such a bitch to him? Simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted Mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson. Just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two-thirds of the movie.<br /><br />""Swept Away"" is a silly, simplistic, superficial movie from beginning to end. Madonna gives a typically wooden performance. There are many dumb scenes: Madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of Giannini, a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt. Guy Ritchie does his ""stylish"" editing which is laughable here. The film contains some of the worst dialog I've heard in a major movie in several years. The ending is sappy and implausible. It's basically ""The Blue Lagoon"" meets ""Overboard"" minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter.<br /><br />Maybe Madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress. Please give it up, Madge, for our sake as well as yours. This isn't her worst movie though. That distinction still belongs to ""Shanghai Surprise"". She hasn't made anything worse than that...yet.",0, may contain spoilers  i bent over backwards to be fair to this film  i knew it starred madonna  i knew it lasted a whole week in theaters  i knew it got a lot of bad reviews  i wasnt expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class  culture and sexuality like we got in the italian original  the benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes  madonna plays a rich  pretentious  nit witted gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends  the brunette woman is as bad as madonna  exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions   adriano giannini plays the ships first mate who the madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together  why is she such a bitch to him  simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson  just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two thirds of the movie   swept away  is a silly  simplistic  superficial movie from beginning to end  madonna gives a typically wooden performance  there are many dumb scenes  madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of giannini  a fantasy scene with madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt  guy ritchie does his  stylish  editing which is laughable here  the film contains some of the worst dialog ive heard in a major movie in several years  the ending is sappy and implausible  its basically  the blue lagoon  meets  overboard  minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter  maybe madonnas ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress  please give it up  madge  for our sake as well as yours  this isnt her worst movie though  that distinction still belongs to  shanghai surprise   she hasnt made anything worse than that   yet 
"Aside from the great movie METROPOLIS, this is about the oldest pure sci-fi movie. While at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad, it is a great film for two reasons. First, it is extremely original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films I can think of that are anything like it. Second, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible--using matte paintings, models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. Sure, you could sit back and knock the film because, by today's standards, the effects are only so-so. But, you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences. In many ways, the sets look highly reminiscent of the ""modern cities"" featured at the 1939 WORLD'S FAIR.<br /><br />I think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question ""are people really THAT stupid or are we destined for greatness?"" The end result seems to be a little of both! How true!<br /><br />A final note: I saw this twice on TV and just a short time ago on video. All three times the sound and print quality stank--particularly the sound. If this is available on a DVD, hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning. As the sound on the video kept cutting out, I really would have appreciated this!",1,aside from the great movie metropolis  this is about the oldest pure sci fi movie  while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad  it is a great film for two reasons  first  it is extremely original in both style and content  even in the 21st century  there are no films i can think of that are anything like it  second  for its time  the special effects were absolutely incredible  using matte paintings  models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow  sure  you could sit back and knock the film because  by todays standards  the effects are only so so  but  you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences  in many ways  the sets look highly reminiscent of the  modern cities  featured at the 1939 worlds fair  i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question  are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness   the end result seems to be a little of both  how true  a final note  i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video  all three times the sound and print quality stank  particularly the sound  if this is available on a dvd  hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning  as the sound on the video kept cutting out  i really would have appreciated this 
"""Piece is Cake"" is defeatist, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the (admittedly fictional) pilots it portrays. It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />In the March 1989 ""Aeroplane Monthly"", Roland Beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV mini-series. A few of his comments are worth repeating:<br /><br />""There was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that I saw in action, and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'Piece of Cake'. It would not have been tolerated for a moment... ...The prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club, though with more discipline. Nor was there any sense of 'death or glory'. RAF training had insisted that we were there to defend this country, and now we were required to do it - no more and no less.<br /><br />""There was no discussion of 'bravery' or 'cowardice'. People either had guts or they did not - but mostly they did. But we knew fear, recognised it in ourselves and in each other, did our damnedness to control it, and then got on with the job...<br /><br />""...I could feel no 'glory', but there was a sense of greatness, and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'Piece of Cake'.""<br /><br />Beamont was, in his own words, ""a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the recent TV series, was there at the time"".<br /><br />Beamont served with 87 Squadron both in France and the BoB, before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the Typhoon and Tempest, and a post-war test pilot.<br /><br />""Piece of Cake"" is an absolute, total misrepresentation of the way pilots in Fighter Command acted at the time.

"This is one of the most hilariously bad movies I have ever had the privilege to see.<br /><br />I watched this on DVD with a bunch of friends one Friday night and we just couldn't stop laughing from start to finish.<br /><br />The story is simple enough: terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium, but it's actually carrying a bunch of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy mistake to make. Cue a startlingly incompetent team of Army Special Forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected 'Smell the fart' acting, as advocated by Joey in Friends.<br /><br />There's plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting, but unfortunately Rance's team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant, lumbering monsters. Also, the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a Velociraptor attacks (preumably so we can't see how bad the creature effects are).<br /><br />Having said all that, we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next.<br /><br />As a Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur's crotch, but as ludicrous, tongue-in-cheek entertainment it's a roaring success.",0,this is one of the most hilariously bad movies i have ever had the privilege to see  i watched this on dvd with a bunch of friends one friday night and we just couldnt stop laughing from start to finish  the story is simple enough  terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium  but its actually carrying a bunch of man eating dinosaurs  easy mistake to make  cue a startlingly incompetent team of army special forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts  they are led by colonel rance  played by scott valentine  a man who seems to have perfected smell the fart acting  as advocated by joey in friends  theres plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting  but unfortunately rances team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant  lumbering monsters  also  the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a velociraptor attacks  preumably so we cant see how bad the creature effects are   having said all that  we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next  as a jusassic park   aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaurs crotch  but as ludicrous  tongue in cheek entertainment its a roaring success 
"I enjoyed this film. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. It was amusing at times, but really, it wasn't very funny at all. If I'd been expecting it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, I found it to be enjoyable and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man who's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. He's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; me, I compare it to The Fountainhead.",1,i enjoyed this film  but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy  it was amusing at times  but really  it wasnt very funny at all  if id been expecting it to be a comedy  i might have been disappointed with the film  but  going in with no expectations  i found it to be enjoyable and engaging  maybe it was because  as an engineer  i identified with the protagonist  i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor  and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention  a man whos less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production  hes absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention  so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park  me  i compare it to the fountainhead

"Not to be confused with Lewis Teague's ""Alligator"" (1980) which actually IS an excellent film, this ""Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano"" laboriously ends the exotic trilogy Sergio Martino made around the end of the seventies (including the rather watchable ""L'Isola degli uomini pesce"" and the not so good ""La Montagna del dio cannibale""). Tracing outrageously the plot of ""Jaws"", the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever. The creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable. Stelvio Cipriani's lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the reptile's meal. No thrill out of this, rather laughters actually! And we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism. Very soon the giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a patronizing attitude. We could excuse badly made films and poor FXs, but not that kind of mentality.

"First of all, I'd like to say that I love the ""Ladies' Man"" sketch on SNL. I always laugh out loud at Tim Meadows' portrayal of Leon Phelps. However, there is a difference between an 8-minute sketch and a feature-length movie. Watching Leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show, like ""The Ladies Man Presents..."" which is reminiscent of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents..."" is absolutely hilarious. There's a great episode where Cameron Diaz role-plays Monica Lewinski, and Leon plays Bill and they call it ""The Oral Office."" See, that's funny!!! <br /><br />In the movie, we don't see Leon on the show too often. In fact, he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country. And the plot revolves around his quest for true love, involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat, signed by ""Sweet Thing."" Karyn Parsons, who is famous for playing Hillary on ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air,"" works with him on the show and has a secret crush on Leon. The movie just piles on one boring subplot after another. And the gags are boring as well. The first time we see Leon mention the word ""wang"" it's pretty funny. When he uses it over and over again, supposedly trying to get a laugh, the joke has run dry. Most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before, and done better, on the SNL sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty-five minutes. They even try to insert a musical number by Will Ferrell and his gang of Ladies' Man haters, who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him, to bring some life into this witless comedy. Ferrell has some funny moments, and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role. Ferrell just has that unique comic talent, and he's funny at almost anything he does. Even Julianne Moore gets a cameo. Watching her, you can't but wonder ""What the hell is an Oscar-winning actress doing in this movie??!!!!"" Her name wasn't mentioned in the opening credits--probably by her consent. And of course a movie of this theme has to include the Master of Love himself, Billy Dee Williams. Billy Dee is charismatic as always, but even he can't breathe enough life into this film. I also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft R & B hits, which impairs the film even more, giving it a horribly downbeat tone--as if the script isn't boring enough. I mean, this is ""supposed"" to be a comedy. The soundtrack would've been appropriate for something like ""Love Jones."" <br /><br />""The Ladies Man"" only has sporadic laughs. There are exceptions in which SNL can produce a great movie out of a short sketch. Watch both of the ""Wayne's World"" movies, and you'll see how it's done. But this movie, just like adapting Mary Catherine Gallagher's character to screen in ""Superstar,"" shows the flip side. Some sketches are meant to be remembered on SNL, and not on the silver screen.<br /><br />My score: 3 (out of 10)",0,first of all  id like to say that i love the  ladies man  sketch on snl  i always laugh out loud at tim meadows portrayal of leon phelps  however  there is a difference between an 8 minute sketch and a feature length movie  watching leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show  like  the ladies man presents     which is reminiscent of  alfred hitchcock presents     is absolutely hilarious  theres a great episode where cameron diaz role plays monica lewinski  and leon plays bill and they call it  the oral office   see  thats funny     in the movie  we dont see leon on the show too often  in fact  he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country  and the plot revolves around his quest for true love  involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat  signed by  sweet thing   karyn parsons  who is famous for playing hillary on  fresh prince of bel air   works with him on the show and has a secret crush on leon  the movie just piles on one boring subplot after another  and the gags are boring as well  the first time we see leon mention the word  wang  its pretty funny  when he uses it over and over again  supposedly trying to get a laugh  the joke has run dry  most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before  and done better  on the snl sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty five minutes  they even try to insert a musical number by will ferrell and his gang of ladies man haters  who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him  to bring some life into this witless comedy  ferrell has some funny moments  and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role  ferrell just has that unique comic talent  and hes funny at almost anything he does  even julianne moore gets a cameo  watching her  you cant but wonder  what the hell is an oscar winning actress doing in this movie        her name wasnt mentioned in the opening credits  probably by her consent  and of course a movie of this theme has to include the master of love himself  billy dee williams  billy dee is charismatic as always  but even he cant breathe enough life into this film  i also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft r   b hits  which impairs the film even more  giving it a horribly downbeat tone  as if the script isnt boring enough  i mean  this is  supposed  to be a comedy  the soundtrack wouldve been appropriate for something like  love jones     the ladies man  only has sporadic laughs  there are exceptions in which snl can produce a great movie out of a short sketch  watch both of the  waynes world  movies  and youll see how its done  but this movie  just like adapting mary catherine gallaghers character to screen in  superstar   shows the flip side  some sketches are meant to be remembered on snl  and not on the silver screen  my score  3  out of 10 
"When someone remakes a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original. Also, there's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences.<br /><br />Well, the 1973 TV version of ""Double Indemnity"" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. The main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous, leering insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna just seems world-weary and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's boss Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a fine actor, appears almost bored with the proceedings. Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the conniving, back-stabbing Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role, Eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place.<br /><br />Robert Webber, in the old Richard Gaines role as Robinson's boss Norton, and John Fiedler taking the Porter Hall role as the crucial witness, bring some life to the movie. In particular, Webber recreates the Norton role well in a 1970s context.<br /><br />However, after the movie starts, the whole thing just sort of lies there, without any life or electricity. This is one film that never should have been remade.",0,when someone remakes a classic movie  the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original  also  theres a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences  well  the 1973 tv version of  double indemnity  has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original  the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all  fred macmurray was great as the lecherous  leering insurance agent walter neff in the original  richard crenna just seems world weary and tired  edward g  robinson brought great manic energy to his role as macmurrays boss barton keys  lee j  cobb  a fine actor  appears almost bored with the proceedings  samantha eggar is all wrong as the conniving  back stabbing phyllis dietrichson  while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role  eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place  robert webber  in the old richard gaines role as robinsons boss norton  and john fiedler taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness  bring some life to the movie  in particular  webber recreates the norton role well in a 1970s context  however  after the movie starts  the whole thing just sort of lies there  without any life or electricity  this is one film that never should have been remade

"Sarah Silverman is really the ""flavor of the month"" comic right now. Is she really worth all the hype? Yes and no. She is funny at times, sometimes hilariously so (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, though not always funny). Other times, you're feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer. She is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to, saying that they dig her intelligence and wit. But if you corner them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her. She reminds me of why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, even though neither of them are really ""hot"" now in terms of popularity. Sarah doesn't drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she's 60, so her fans (especially the male ones) can rejoice.<br /><br />As for this show, it's very much like her comedy. When it works, it's hilarious. When it doesn't, it's full blown tedium and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best one. It's consistently funny, and has some really good satire in it. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's hilarious seeing him in a Tab T-shirt. But they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually wears out its welcome. Sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guy) seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole, and the supporting players (including Sarah's real life sister, Laura, who doesn't look a thing like her) are OK. When the jokes hit, they're brilliant. When they don't, they're awful, and I mean really awful. There's also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today. So should you watch this show? If you have a crush on Sarah, go for it. You can gaze at her and pretend she's yours. As for her show, it's ranges from good to absolute zero.",0,sarah silverman is really the  flavor of the month  comic right now  is she really worth all the hype  yes and no  she is funny at times  sometimes hilariously so  her standup routine is actually quite interesting  though not always funny   other times  youre feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer  she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to  saying that they dig her intelligence and wit  but if you corner them  most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her  and thats why they watch her  she reminds me of why many men flocked to margaret cho and janeane garofalo  even though neither of them are really  hot  now in terms of popularity  sarah doesnt drink or smoke  at least cigs   so she should be hot when shes 60  so her fans  especially the male ones  can rejoice  as for this show  its very much like her comedy  when it works  its hilarious  when it doesnt  its full blown tedium and very  very boring  the aids episode here is the best one  its consistently funny  and has some really good satire in it  brian poeshns character has an unhealthy obsession with tab in one episode  and its hilarious seeing him in a tab t shirt  but they never really go anywhere with it  and it eventually wears out its welcome  sarahs character in the series is rather annoying  the gay couple  brian poeshn and some other guy  seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole  and the supporting players  including sarahs real life sister  laura  who doesnt look a thing like her  are ok  when the jokes hit  theyre brilliant  when they dont  theyre awful  and i mean really awful  theres also an obsession with coprophilia here  aka poop jokes   which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today  so should you watch this show  if you have a crush on sarah  go for it  you can gaze at her and pretend shes yours  as for her show  its ranges from good to absolute zero 
"I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago. With little money for entertainment, I rented it for my fiancé and I to watch on a bone chilling winter's night. The movie I had wanted was gone, so I rented this instead, not expecting much, and was very much surprised with how good it was. I just recently watched it again, and loved it every bit as much as the first time. <br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, it's about Scottish outlaw Robert Roy MacGregor, a cattleman and folk hero. From the little I know about the man and his story, liberties have been taken with the facts, but it's a movie, not a textbook, and so the filmmakers can be excused. Basically, the plot of the movie is that Rob Roy borrows money from the Marquis of Montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from. But, his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest. Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis, and Mary, his wife, suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham, a smarmy Englishman with no soul. Atrocities ensue, until, in an immensely satisfying conclusion, Rob carves Archibald up like a Christmas turkey. <br /><br />There are many great performances in this movie, but allow me to touch specifically on a few. Liam Neeson, as usual, is fantastic, a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of. Honestly, this man is like ice cream: even when he's bad he's good. His Rob Roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him, in the best way he knows how. Jessica Lange, as Mary, gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering, dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure. You just know she doesn't take any b.s from Rob, or anyone else for that matter. Tim Roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil Archibald, yet somehow, it works. All the posturing and preening, combined with some wicked dialogue, result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory. Combine all of this, and the stellar work by other supporting players, with the luscious scenery of Scotland, and you have what amounts to one really, really cool movie.

"BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap.<br /><br />I've never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful. Like the movies I said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He is the worst out there.<br /><br />The credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in. The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots. The editing is easily the worst. This movie made no sense and I unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I couldn't take it anymore.

"It's rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy that isn't incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie (eg. Big Fat Greek wedding; Me, Myself & Irene). There were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie, nothing unpalatably profane. All around, it was a cute movie with likable characters. I thought the ending was a little abrupt. It feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish. The acting left a little to be desired, but was made up for by the pace of the story. If I'd known it was a Farrelly brothers movie I would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it, but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie. Good for them, I hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films.",1,its rare  nowadays  to find a romantic comedy that isnt incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie  eg  big fat greek wedding  me  myself   irene   there were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie  nothing unpalatably profane  all around  it was a cute movie with likable characters  i thought the ending was a little abrupt  it feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish  the acting left a little to be desired  but was made up for by the pace of the story  if id known it was a farrelly brothers movie i would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it  but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie  good for them  i hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films 
"I know Anime. I've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was. And just so you know I'm not bragging about my, let me say this: out of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award; this isn't an exaggeration - I've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who'd only ever seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three. Personally, I'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke, until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think that the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing. In either case, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and think that that is Miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken.",1,i know anime  ive been into it long before it became a national phenomenon  i loved ranma before most people knew what dragonball z even was  and just so you know im not bragging about my  let me say this  out of all the animes ive seen  castle in the sky is by far one of the best  its obvious people say spirited away is the best  but i really disagree  most people only know that movie because it one an acedmy award  this isnt an exaggeration   ive shown princess mononoke and castle in the sky to people whod only ever seen spirited away  and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three  personally  id never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke  until i finally saw castle in the sky  i still think that the prior is the better of the two  but castle in the sky is easily on par with it  in many ways  castle has major elements that mononoke was missing  in either case  if youve only seen spirited away  and think that that is miyazakis best film  be prepared to have your earth shaken 
"I just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget, now my take on things.<br /><br />The CGI monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all. When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. They may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jacksons early films.<br /><br />As for the acting Beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where.<br /><br />The script seemed confused to me. One minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club Shakespeare speech. I'm not say it should be all 'ye' and 'that it be' but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person.<br /><br />I did notice one part near the start when Beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents.<br /><br />In short, this film is a very slightly polished turd, but a turn none the less.",0,i just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget  now my take on things  the cgi monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way  the fight scenes werent even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all  when the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro  in my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets  they may not look as fancy but at least they interact  just look at peter jacksons early films  as for the acting beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where  the script seemed confused to me  one minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club shakespeare speech  im not say it should be all ye and that it be but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person  i did notice one part near the start when beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents  in short  this film is a very slightly polished turd  but a turn none the less 
"This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With. Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent, stayed up late to do so, was very annoyed to find that it was about 95% romance,4% everything else, 1% history if that. It's what I call a bait and switch movie, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment, this movie is almost an insult to those who served. The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes, they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter's character. Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls, an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days, it would have either been the stockade or the infantry. Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment.",0,this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with  saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent  stayed up late to do so  was very annoyed to find that it was about 95  romance 4  everything else  1  history if that  its what i call a bait and switch movie  one with an interesting title  the actual movie is a scam  this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment  this movie is almost an insult to those who served  the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes  they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france  and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunters character  flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls  an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldnt have lasted two days  it would have either been the stockade or the infantry  discipline in the french army was often rather fierce  in short  another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment 
"Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me snifflin' like a baby as I left the theatre, trying not to let anyone see. So, when I saw it again now in '07, I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. Thankfully this time I was at home.<br /><br />What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it, was the technical brilliance of this movie. The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue. The camera work which seemed to place the viewer, together with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner, the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /><br />The story itself, & the characters - seedy, sad & brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a great movie.",1,saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released  had me snifflin like a baby as i left the theatre  trying not to let anyone see  so  when i saw it again now in 07  i knew what to expect   the sobs were ready   primed as their required moment approached  thankfully this time i was at home  what i hadnt remembered from my youthful viewing  or perhaps hadnt noticed because of it  was the technical brilliance of this movie  the use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue  the camera work which seemed to place the viewer  together with the characters in the scene  think of the opening when joe is crossing the street to the diner  the camera pans behind the woman   child sitting on a bench in the foreground  framing the street scene   the story itself    the characters   seedy  sad   brutally real  it is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn  then again  joe   ratso could be any of us  must have been 70 when i saw it  i recall that upon leaving the theatre i was impelled to find the company of friends  all these years later  im glad im not alone tonight  this is one hell of a great movie

"Acting This film is a very well acted film. I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times; but for the most part, the acting is very good. The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you were to pause it, you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. He sets up every shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera is still, there is a postcard like quality to the screen. When the camera is moving, every shot is planned to understated perfection. But it doesn't stop there. Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work I've seen. His work on this movie made it what it is. This movie is at the top of the list for best Cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but, I believe they missed the point of the movie. It is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other. The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. The music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores I've herd. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world. I will be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.",1,acting this film is a very well acted film  i will say that the performances are slightly weak at times  but for the most part  the acting is very good  the only actor that blew me away with his performance was jude law as harlen maguire  he was incredible  tom hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible  paul newman  good as always  cinematography this is what made the movie a masterpiece  and i rarely use that word   conrad hall is a true genius  if at any point in the movie you were to pause it  you will see the delicately crafted work of this man  he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out  when the camera is still  there is a postcard like quality to the screen  when the camera is moving  every shot is planned to understated perfection  but it doesnt stop there  conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art  the way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work ive seen  his work on this movie made it what it is  this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr  black hawk down  hero  cthd  moulin rouge  and vertigo  story people will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but  i believe they missed the point of the movie  it is a love story about a hit man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose  it is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other  the screen writing is worthy of an oscar  music thomas newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story  the music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores ive herd  direction sam mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director  the symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film making world  i will be on the lookout for the next sam mendes film  10 10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies ive ever seen

"Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they're caught, they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot, but out of sight. The prisoners plead to be let go, but rules are rules.<br /><br />Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disarming to discover that Offside is a comedy, and a frequently hilarious one. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is ""real"". In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place.<br /><br />However, thinking now about Offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy, because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous. As the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer, the only possible outcome is comedy.<br /><br />What makes Offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply soccer fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp.",1,several young iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain  when theyre caught  theyre penned in an area where the match remains within earshot  but out of sight  the prisoners plead to be let go  but rules are rules  given the pedigree of its director  jafar panahi  it was disarming to discover that offside is a comedy  and a frequently hilarious one  in 1997s the mirror  panahi presents two versions of iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is  real   in 2000s the circle  several iranian women step outside the system  their transgressions are different  but they all end up in the same tragic place  however  thinking now about offside  its hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy  because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous  as the women demand to know why they cant watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer  the only possible outcome is comedy  what makes offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system  they are simply soccer fans and patriots  and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly  they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nations grasp 
"Spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league.<br /><br />But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent. Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.<br /><br />Ah well, the script ain't too hot either.

"The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.<br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer. The acting, in particular, was extremely poor. Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. The storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. The movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth.<br /><br />Final say?

"The Western society has been fed ideas about India being a poor country. Movies like these only make those beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it all the more difficult for Indians to be accepted abroad. Agreed there are poor and homeless in India, but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful ones.<br /><br />I totally hated the idea of the movie portraying Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teressa. In my opinion this movie has shown India in a very bad light giving wrong notions. It is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society. Exactly the reason why people ask me, ""When we go to India, can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and snakes?""<br /><br />Those who want a second opinion on contemporary Indian society should watch ""Monsoon Wedding"".",0,the western society has been fed ideas about india being a poor country  movies like these only make those beliefs stronger  such illustrations make it all the more difficult for indians to be accepted abroad  agreed there are poor and homeless in india  but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful ones  i totally hated the idea of the movie portraying patrick swayze as another mother teressa  in my opinion this movie has shown india in a very bad light giving wrong notions  it is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society  exactly the reason why people ask me   when we go to india  can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and snakes   those who want a second opinion on contemporary indian society should watch  monsoon wedding  
"I would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful. If there are people who watch this piece and think that ""well then Jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in WW2"", then the movie is very cleverly made to conceal 'why's and 'how's as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live. What more can a propaganda movie aim for? The part in which an American movie about the Rothschild family is included is re-used very shrewdly here, for instance. The question of why the Jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked. No one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social strata.<br /><br />Besides, the level of excitement (or, the level of disgust) in the movie increases slowly and the solution-like end of the movie suits the aim and the musts of doing propaganda. The audience would leave in joy and gratefulness to the times that are coming up...well done.<br /><br />In the movie, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The movie is kind of history today, so no need to fuss much about it actually. However, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful watcher can find relevance to today's cultural hatred, violence, decivilization as well as the problems of integration.

Was it true? <br /><br />Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a Cinemax-style skin flick set on board a spaceship!<br /><br />Sad as it is, ""Alien Intruder"" tries to be unique, with a computer virus/alien demon/harpy/whatever else you want to call her named Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrating this sort-of high-tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over-seen by their captain (Williams).<br /><br />Interesting? Maybe, but here everything just plays out like a well-padded episode of ""Red Shoe Diaries"". Williams out-classes everything right and left, and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else, ANYWHERE else. Ah, the things people do for money....<br /><br />The FX are pretty static, maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this. Unfortunately, even the female nudity is less than you'd expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here and, of course, it gets ALL the best scenes.<br /><br />If you like a movie that's all tease and no brains, check out ""Alien Intruder"".

"Inspector Gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's cartoon. I enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992's Christmas special ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"". Some Gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season (1985) of the show, but they need to compare it to DiC's 2002 release of ""Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge"" for then, they will find the second season to be absolute gold.<br /><br />Being a Gadget fan, I couldn't resist the opportunity to see the animated Inspector Gadget in something that wasn't Gadget Boy-related. I purchased the film, and I swore to myself that I'd be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series. I was not even prepared for what I was about to watch.<br /><br />There was barely a shred of the original show still intact.<br /><br />Here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie: *The humor is non-existent from the original series.<br /><br />*Penny and Brain (originally having a nearly equal part in the series as Gadget) are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals.<br /><br />*The original music by Saban & Levy is not there, and the score that exists is sub-par. (Understood that Saban has his own production company now, but at least ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"" had good music, even without Saban.) *Don't expect to see any of Gadget's gadgets which made the show so endearing, such as gadget-copter, gadget-brella, gadget-mallet,gadget-coat (which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing), as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets. In this movie, his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs. That kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show, and simply aren't necessary to change.<br /><br />*The gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fast-talking, supposedly ""hip"" convertible. All the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa.<br /><br />*Chief Quimby is now very short-tempered and even mean to Gadget. He was always grumpy in the original series, but this pushes the situation a bit much.<br /><br />*Penny no longer has a computer book.<br /><br />Are there any positives to this movie? OK, here goes...<br /><br />*Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget.<br /><br />*In one scene, Chief Quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series: the Great Wambini (classic ""Gadget"" villain from the second season, voiced by Louis Nye).<br /><br />Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie? Well, you're out of luck. Life is about making choices and living by those choices. Most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson. The lesson learned here: keep to the original formula! ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" True Gadget fans should steer clear from this movie; you will surely be disappointed.<br /><br />Hopefully, DiC and Shout! Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of ""Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1,"" containing the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true Gadget fan, lover of 80's animation and many of DiC's programs, I urge you the viewer to purchase ""Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1"" and ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"" DVD's which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories.",0,inspector gadget was probably my all time favorite 80s cartoon  i enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992s christmas special  inspector gadget saves christmas   some gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season  1985  of the show  but they need to compare it to dics 2002 release of  inspector gadgets last case  claws revenge  for then  they will find the second season to be absolute gold  being a gadget fan  i couldnt resist the opportunity to see the animated inspector gadget in something that wasnt gadget boy related  i purchased the film  and i swore to myself that id be objective  i knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series  i was not even prepared for what i was about to watch  there was barely a shred of the original show still intact  here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie   the humor is non existent from the original series   penny and brain  originally having a nearly equal part in the series as gadget  are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals   the original music by saban   levy is not there  and the score that exists is sub par   understood that saban has his own production company now  but at least  inspector gadget saves christmas  had good music  even without saban    dont expect to see any of gadgets gadgets which made the show so endearing  such as gadget copter  gadget brella  gadget mallet gadget coat  which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing   as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets  in this movie  his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs  that kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show  and simply arent necessary to change   the gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fast talking  supposedly  hip  convertible  all the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa   chief quimby is now very short tempered and even mean to gadget  he was always grumpy in the original series  but this pushes the situation a bit much   penny no longer has a computer book  are there any positives to this movie  ok  here goes     maurice lamarche does a good job of taking over for the great don adams as inspector gadget   in one scene  chief quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series  the great wambini  classic  gadget  villain from the second season  voiced by louis nye   looking for more redeeming factors for this movie  well  youre out of luck  life is about making choices and living by those choices  most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson  the lesson learned here  keep to the original formula   if it aint broke  dont fix it   true gadget fans should steer clear from this movie  you will surely be disappointed  hopefully  dic and shout  factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of  inspector gadget  the original series  volume 1   containing the first 22 episodes of the series  as a true gadget fan  lover of 80s animation and many of dics programs  i urge you the viewer to purchase  inspector gadget  the original series  volume 1  and  inspector gadget saves christmas  dvds which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories 
"Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie. The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay. But, although I was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion (I am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I don't know.

"This film came out 12 years years ago, and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in New York. The textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses. Anthony Slide's 'Great Pretenders' says nothing. Julian Fleisher's ""The Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide"" with its flow chart of influence that pulls together Julian Eltinge, Minette, the Warhol queens, and the 90s club scene - and postdates the film - ignores the houses completely. Even Laurence Senelick's ""The Changing Room"" - the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it.<br /><br />I understand from the film itself,and various articles I found on the web that this house system goes back decades. The major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in ""The Queen"", 1968. The historical context is the biggest missing part of ""Paris is Burning"".<br /><br />The film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored. It is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending, but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real-life murder. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet, but this did not come out until three years later.<br /><br />Of historical importance, but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context.",1,this film came out 12 years years ago  and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york  the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses  anthony slides great pretenders says nothing  julian fleishers  the drag queens of new york  an illustrated field guide  with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge  minette  the warhol queens  and the 90s club scene   and postdates the film   ignores the houses completely  even laurence senelicks  the changing room    the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it  i understand from the film itself and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades  the major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be chrystal la beija in  the queen   1968  the historical context is the biggest missing part of  paris is burning   the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored  it is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989  the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending  but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real life murder  as we now know  dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet  but this did not come out until three years later  of historical importance  but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context 
"I have seen this film only once, on TV, and it has not been repeated. This is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again. Usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement, but this one really scared me.<br /><br />DO NOT READ THE NEXT BIT IF YOU HAVE'NT SEEN THE FILM YET<br /><br />The scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead (they'd been poisoning her). He asks who the hell are you people anyway. One by one they give their true identities.

"When I was a kid in the 50's and 60's anything connected with Disney was by definition great. What happened? They are able to get any actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But somehow Disney manages to screw things up in spite of their abundant resources.<br /><br />Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still...they screw things up! This movie is crap. The sad thing is that I suspect Disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad.<br /><br />It is only due to the talent of the actors that I can even give it a 3 of 10.",0,when i was a kid in the 50s and 60s anything connected with disney was by definition great  what happened  they are able to get any actors and actresses they want  the best of their time  but somehow disney manages to screw things up in spite of their abundant resources  disney can afford the best writers  the best producers and directors  but still   they screw things up  this movie is crap  the sad thing is that i suspect disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad  it is only due to the talent of the actors that i can even give it a 3 of 10 
"What can you say about the film White Fire. Amazing? Fantastic? Disturbing? Hilarious? These words are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire. From wobbly, garbled beginning to profound end, this movie will entertain throughout.<br /><br />Our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world. A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. When the father separates from the mother and their childen, you get a real sense of what kind of movie you're about to watch. Father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit, and is polite as he gets people's attention before he shoots them, but alas, dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised, unsafe stunt. Meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them. He too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre ""HALT!"", and then promptly wastes the mother. This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred.<br /><br />So now we fast forward about 20 years (30 if you're honest about the hero's age) to beautiful Turkey, where Bo and Ingred have settled as professional thieves, or diamond prospectors, or something. Ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods, while Bo (masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty) drives around the desert in his denim outfits. Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship. They don't seem to have any friends other than each other, and they spend all of their time together. That coupled with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as ""you know its a shame you're my sister"" he says to her while she's stark naked, make for a very dynamic duo. Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed, as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid, and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid. This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. Bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas, and he is overjoyed with his new love.<br /><br />So anyway, there's a lot of fun action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, impossible to follow plot-lines, Fred ""the hammer"" Williamson (for some reason), and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes). All of these things are great, but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire. You may be glad you did..or not.",1,what can you say about the film white fire  amazing  fantastic  disturbing  hilarious  these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire  from wobbly  garbled beginning to profound end  this movie will entertain throughout  our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world  a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms  when the father separates from the mother and their childen  you get a real sense of what kind of movie youre about to watch  father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit  and is polite as he gets peoples attention before he shoots them  but alas  dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised  unsafe stunt  meanwhile  mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them  he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre  halt    and then promptly wastes the mother  this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred  so now we fast forward about 20 years  30 if youre honest about the heros age  to beautiful turkey  where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves  or diamond prospectors  or something  ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods  while bo  masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty  drives around the desert in his denim outfits  bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship  they dont seem to have any friends other than each other  and they spend all of their time together  that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as  you know its a shame youre my sister  he says to her while shes stark naked  make for a very dynamic duo  bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed  as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf  a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid  and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid  this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong  bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas  and he is overjoyed with his new love  so anyway  theres a lot of fun action scenes  ridiculous violence  great acting  impossible to follow plot lines  fred  the hammer  williamson  for some reason   and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond  which later explodes   all of these things are great  but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special    really special  so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire  you may be glad you did  or not

"Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind.

"I've seen all kinds of ""Hamlet""s. <br /><br />Kenneth Branagh's was most ambitious, Mel Gibson's was quick and to the point, Laurence Olivier's was the best - hands down. But now we come to Maximilian Schell's take on the Bard.<br /><br />For one, this is a dubbed version of a German TV production of William Shakespeare's venerable chestnut. But if there's a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and worse-staged version out there somewhere, it must have been acted at grade school-level. <br /><br />Having seen it on MST3K helps, with Mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy, puncturing the profundity of black and white TV, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of Germans acting out an English play and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman reject.<br /><br />Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs. Best lines? ""I'm gonna unleash the Great Dane"", ""I don't think so, 'breather'"", ""Meet the Beatles"", ""Hey, Dad, will you help me with my science project"" and, my personal favorite, during a party - ""Garrison Keillor's leaving Germany (YAAAY!!)"".<br /><br />But then there's Schell, playing Shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would, only not as expressive. No doubt he's a great actor, but here he comes off about as well as Paul Newman in ""The Silver Chalice"". Ever see that one? You GOTTA watch these two on a double-bill!<br /><br />In the end, this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book. At least the book isn't dubbed by Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />One star only for this ""Hamlet""; ten stars, naturally, for the MST3K version.<br /><br />Good-night, not-so-sweet prince.",0,ive seen all kinds of  hamlet s   kenneth branaghs was most ambitious  mel gibsons was quick and to the point  laurence oliviers was the best   hands down  but now we come to maximilian schells take on the bard  for one  this is a dubbed version of a german tv production of william shakespeares venerable chestnut  but if theres a slower  more plodding  more lethargic and worse staged version out there somewhere  it must have been acted at grade school level   having seen it on mst3k helps  with mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy  puncturing the profundity of black and white tv  shakespeare and the wisdom     of germans acting out an english play and making it look like an ingmar bergman reject  of course  the best parts are the mst riffs  best lines   im gonna unleash the great dane    i dont think so  breather    meet the beatles    hey  dad  will you help me with my science project  and  my personal favorite  during a party    garrison keillors leaving germany  yaaay      but then theres schell  playing shakespeares greatest character much like a department store mannequin would  only not as expressive  no doubt hes a great actor  but here he comes off about as well as paul newman in  the silver chalice   ever see that one  you gotta watch these two on a double bill  in the end  this is one instance where its true that youre much better off to just read the book  at least the book isnt dubbed by ricardo montalban  one star only for this  hamlet   ten stars  naturally  for the mst3k version  good night  not so sweet prince 
"A charming, funny film that gets a solid grade all around. I saw a screener of this film recently at work. It was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies I see every day. So much so, that I figured I'd write in. Not sure if this film is going to theaters, but I hope it does. Its a nice film to see with friends, its a charmer, and has some funny jokes. The acting was terrific (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf. The directing was pretty good (not a film that needed to be over-directed). What really makes this film stand out I think is the writing. It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm. As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice those things! (I'm a dork). Anyway, a really cute film that I recommend.",1,a charming  funny film that gets a solid grade all around  i saw a screener of this film recently at work  it was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies i see every day  so much so  that i figured id write in  not sure if this film is going to theaters  but i hope it does  its a nice film to see with friends  its a charmer  and has some funny jokes  the acting was terrific  especially howard hessman and larry dorf  the directing was pretty good  not a film that needed to be over directed   what really makes this film stand out i think is the writing  it was like neil simon  seinfeldish  and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm  as an aspiring screenwriter  i notice those things   im a dork   anyway  a really cute film that i recommend 
"I wanted to like this film, I really did. It's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat. It tries too hard to be funny in some places (the daughters over zealous cooking attempts), over reaches in others (the scene where they clean up someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, while mildly interesting, are really just filler (all the work scene's). And I didn't find the ""villians"" intimidating, or worth hating, so much as I found them to be childishly annoying. <br /><br />I've met people like those in the film while playing church ball. And I will say the referee's are spot on, Still, in the end, I really didn't care all that much about the characters, or their quest for church ball glory. Maybe because they were all so one dimensional, which I might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall. <br /><br />Kurt Hale, and Halestorm entertainment, has made some good films, but this is not one of them.",0,i wanted to like this film  i really did  its got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat  it tries too hard to be funny in some places  the daughters over zealous cooking attempts   over reaches in others  the scene where they clean up someones yard  so he agrees to join the team  and has some scenes that  while mildly interesting  are really just filler  all the work scenes   and i didnt find the  villians  intimidating  or worth hating  so much as i found them to be childishly annoying   ive met people like those in the film while playing church ball  and i will say the referees are spot on  still  in the end  i really didnt care all that much about the characters  or their quest for church ball glory  maybe because they were all so one dimensional  which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall   kurt hale  and halestorm entertainment  has made some good films  but this is not one of them 
"Dark comedy? Gallows humor? How does one make a comedy out of murder? It can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people. So, the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking, sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis. He meets a struggling businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky beginning, he learns that he needs a friend. But, Greg's happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have, love, home and a life. Add character actor, Philip Baker Hall as the hit-man's manager and we're off to the races. Brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti-hero and Kinnear delightful as his counterpart, the very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a sparkle as Kinnear's very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives. The ending is delightful and with some surprise to it. You should leave the theater feeling, at least, partly good-- if you're able to suspend being aghast at killing people.",1,dark comedy  gallows humor  how does one make a comedy out of murder  it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people  so  the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work  so  pierce brosnan  the irishmans answer to 007 is now cast as a chain smoking  sex addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis  he meets a struggling businessman  greg kinnear  and after a rocky beginning  he learns that he needs a friend  but  gregs happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesnt have  love  home and a life  add character actor  philip baker hall as the hit mans manager and were off to the races  brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart  the very human businessman  hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnears very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives  the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it  you should leave the theater feeling  at least  partly good   if youre able to suspend being aghast at killing people

"A difficult film to categorize. I was never giving it 110% concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared I couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the American FBI characters & what their roles were. Nor could I take the Irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows, not acted out.<br /><br />This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV show, with a largely insignificant sub plot going on, which just seemed to get in the way.

"I believe this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has made to date. This film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen. It is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay.

"After viewing this film, I felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in ""Kill Me Later"". The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. None of that mattered though...at all.<br /><br />I don't know what her deal is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director. She slowed footage down, sped footage up, reversed footage, used awkward camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion quick cuts, jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious ""modern"" soundtrack of blaring junk. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. Her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of. It is crammed down their throats.<br /><br />There are a couple of good scenes in ""Kill Me Later"" which show what could have and should have been. Unfortunately, just when things would start to show promise, Ms. Lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart. 3/10",0,after viewing this film  i felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration  selma blair is a fabulous  currently underrated actress and max beesley was rather charming in  kill me later   the story  while not exactly original  certainly showed some promise  none of that mattered though   at all  i dont know what her deal is  but director dana lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director  she slowed footage down  sped footage up  reversed footage  used awkward camera angles  used annoying color filters  made a zillion quick cuts  jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious  modern  soundtrack of blaring junk  i cant remember the last time i saw such an incompetent job of directing a film  her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of  it is crammed down their throats  there are a couple of good scenes in  kill me later  which show what could have and should have been  unfortunately  just when things would start to show promise  ms  lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again  its a shame because blair and beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart  3 10
"I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest.<br /><br />Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark.<br /><br />However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson. It's badly out of tune.<br /><br />The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is much too short--to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long.<br /><br />Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon--perfection.<br /><br />Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.",0,i confess  emma  in my opinion  is the single greatest novel ever written  it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be  jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here  unfortunately  this is at best a palimpsest  comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable  that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch  there are some good elements here  kate berkinsale  having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm  clearly emmas smarter spiritual twin  is a wonderful emma  raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill  the production is handsome  but the interiors are far too dark  however  there are several major problems  the first is mark strong  first of all  he doesnt look right for mr  knightley  this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson  its badly out of tune  the second problem is one of length  simply put  the film is much too short  to get the right kind of feel  it would need to be twice as long  finally  and most significantly  there is the quality of the adaptation  austen is an adapters dream  all the dialogue is there already  it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly  andrew davies seems to think otherwise  first  this is a rather gloomy film  and the last thing emma should be is gloomy  more significantly  davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast  what planet  or minor work of thomas hardy  is this come from  it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel  and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon  perfection  watch the paltrow version  or watch kate in cold comfort farm 
"Hood of the Living Dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began. First, any play on ""...of the living dead"" invokes His Holiness Mr. Romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to aspire. And second, my movie-watching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptical, we settled in to watch. <br /><br />We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good-hearted zombie film. Oh, certainly the budget is low, and of course the directors' amateurs friends populate the cast, but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yeah. But when it's this cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds it together. <br /><br />Ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night. He dreams of moving out of Oakland. Before this planned escape, however, his brother is shot to death in a drive-by. Ricky's keen scientific mind presents an option superior to CPR or 911: injections of his lab's experimental regenerative formula. Sadly, little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty Oakland zombie! Chaos and mayhem! I think it's more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive-by, but then again, I'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life. (How poor a judge? In response to a gory scene involving four men, I opined ""Ah-ha! White t-shirts on everyone so the blood shows up. Economical! I used the same technique in my own low-budget horror film."" Jordan replied, ""No, that's gang dress. White t-shirts were banned from New Orleans bars for a time as a result."" Oh.)<br /><br />A lot of the movie is set in someone's living room, so there's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies. But the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere-- it surpasses its budget in spirit. <br /><br />Zombie explanation: When man plays God, zombies arise! Or, perhaps: Follow FDA-approved testing rules before human experimentation! <br /><br />Contribution to the zombie canon: This is the first zombie movie I've seen with a drive-by shooting. As far as the actual zombies go, infection is spread with a bite as usual, but quite unusually head shots don't work-- it's heart shots that kill. Zombies have pulses, the absence of which proves true death. And these zombies make pretty cool jaguar-growl noises. <br /><br />Gratuitous zombie movie in-joke: A mercenary named Romero.

"First off, let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie: ""This entire movie had to have been a dare. You know, like, 'DUDE, I BET YOU COULDN'T MAKE THE WORST MOVIE EVER'"". With this movie, they've made a good effort at achieving that title. The effects are, of course, poor. The plot/dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made. The actors, I'm assuming, are supposed to be in college. Yet parts of it (especially at the beginning) make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school. It makes no sense. The Scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable. (SPOILER: At the end, when they chant Lester's name and he reappears, the black guy and Scarecrow are both laughing, probably out of relief they were on their last scene, and at the cheesy dialogue.)",0,first off  let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie   this entire movie had to have been a dare  you know  like  dude  i bet you couldnt make the worst movie ever   with this movie  theyve made a good effort at achieving that title  the effects are  of course  poor  the plot dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made  the actors  im assuming  are supposed to be in college  yet parts of it  especially at the beginning  make it seem like theyre supposed to be in high or middle school  it makes no sense  the scarecrow going around killing people isnt the least bit enjoyable   spoiler  at the end  when they chant lesters name and he reappears  the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing  probably out of relief they were on their last scene  and at the cheesy dialogue

"I am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film. Look at it a month later and you might see it differently, or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first. After sitting through The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael at its UK premiere, it came as no surprise to me that I found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself. Shane Danielsen (Artistic Director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival), aided by the film's director and producer, gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience. Edinburgh Festival audiences are not easily shocked. Only one person walked out in disgust. The criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches M.A. film directors. This was not an overly 'shocking' film. There was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence, but far less extreme than many movies (most actual weapon contact was obscured, as were aroused genitals). The audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring, where the acting standards were not high, where the plot was poor, predictable and drawn out, and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film-making on the promise of a controversial movie. Metaphors to the war in Iraq are contrived, over-emphasised and sloppy (apart from a general allusion to violence, any deeper meaning is unclear); and the 'fig-leaf' reference Marquis de Sade, as one audience member put it, seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale.<br /><br />We have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him (he stands out at school for his musical ability) but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence. When pushed, Robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him.<br /><br />The film is not entirely without merit. The audience is left to decide how Robert got that way: was it the influence of his peers? Why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life? Cinematically, there is a carefully-montaged scene where he hangs back (whether through too much drugs, shyness, a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn?). Several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room, partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen. In the foreground of the bare bones flat, a DJ is more concerned that the girl's screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman. Ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention. The stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way. Robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground.<br /><br />But the rest of the film, including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable (if not overly realistic) sexual violence, is not up to this standard. Some people have had a strong reaction to it (the filmmakers' stated intention: ""If they vomit, we have succeeded in producing a reaction"") but mostly - and as far as I can tell the Edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from Cannes - they feel, ""Why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film-making?"" Director Clay Hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision. His replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet, even his defence that there is little plot development because he didn't want to do a standard Hollywood movie - all are good answers to criticisms, but unfortunately they do not apply to his film, any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates, or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols. Wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt, I spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening, but I found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial. There are many truths. One aspect of art is to educate, another to entertain, another to inspire. I had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions Ken Loach (one of the many great names he takes in vain) without going so far as to admit any agenda himself. He then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth. I am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director, or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work<br /><br />Andy Warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art.

"Lorna Green(Janine Reynaud)is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club. She falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon. It's quite possible that, through a form of hypnotic suggestion, someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding Lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin. After the murders within her fantasies are committed, Lorna awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.<br /><br />If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco, I'd say it's elegant & difficult. By now, you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about, since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. Franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by Godard early in his career, as far as film-making style, and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. And, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering. I'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even Franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched ""Succubus"", admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it! Some might say that ""Succubus"" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, ""Venus in Furs"", considered his masterwork by Franco-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined. In a sense, like the protagonist, we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly, ""Succubus"" is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on. And, a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters. ""Succubus"" is also populated by beatnik types and ""poet-speak"", Corman's film, ""A Bucket of Blood"" poked fun at.

"Although there's Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this movie, it has no connections to the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of kung-fu movie and still stands out as a classic. This is a much inferior copy of the original, and even as a regular kung-fu movie, it's below average.<br /><br />First of all, this movie doesn't have much acting. It's one senseless fight scene after another, and flying guillotine doesn't even play a major part in them. Story is about some Shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who've took off with a sacred book, and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them.<br /><br />There are four movies with Flying Guillotine as part of its title. This in my opinion is of least quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three.<br /><br />The movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production. <br /><br />Best skip this and watch the two originals.",0,although theres flying guillotines as part of the title of this movie  it has no connections to the original flying guillotines  1975  and its sequel flying guillotines ii  1978   the two originals are masterpieces of kung fu movie and still stands out as a classic  this is a much inferior copy of the original  and even as a regular kung fu movie  its below average  first of all  this movie doesnt have much acting  its one senseless fight scene after another  and flying guillotine doesnt even play a major part in them  story is about some shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains whove took off with a sacred book  and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot  the same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them  there are four movies with flying guillotine as part of its title  this in my opinion is of least quality  the design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three  the movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production   best skip this and watch the two originals 
"I really enjoyed this film. All aspects of the film were top notch including the most important, for me anyway, the screenplay and the acting. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is totally convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum might have tackled this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work that I can remember. She impressed so much here that I will definitely be on the lookout for her other work. Thelma Ritter, in an unglamourous role, deserved the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant. This film works on every level. The black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",1,i really enjoyed this film  all aspects of the film were top notch including the most important  for me anyway  the screenplay and the acting  this is definitely one of richard widmarks strongest roles  he is totally convincing in his performance  just out of curiosity  imagine how humphrey bogart or robert mitchum might have tackled this role  this is my first exposure to jean peters work that i can remember  she impressed so much here that i will definitely be on the lookout for her other work  thelma ritter  in an unglamourous role  deserved the oscar nomination she received for playing the informant  this film works on every level  the black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning  widmark and peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance  strongly recommended  9 10 
"So I don't ruin it for you, I'll be very brief. There's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast. A young graduate of Harvard Med School (Brian White) finds out he doesn't know as much as he thinks about people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his internship because a girlfriend (Mya) left him for a job as a TV Producer. His Senior Resident (Wood Harris), helped marvelously by his 'creative collaborator'(Zoe Saldana) bring him up to speed. They help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be true for many of my pre-med friends).",1,so i dont ruin it for you  ill be very brief  theres some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast  a young graduate of harvard med school  brian white  finds out he doesnt know as much as he thinks about people  he goes to a small hospital in florida for his internship because a girlfriend  mya  left him for a job as a tv producer  his senior resident  wood harris   helped marvelously by his creative collaborator zoe saldana  bring him up to speed  they help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money  as seems to be true for many of my pre med friends

"There is just one word for this film. Appalling. The director clearly has talent but like his character Robert Carmichael he throws it all away.<br /><br />Carmichael has potential, but like Cray he can't be bothered to use it. Being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is Cray's vision of British youth. Like the British tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect. Cray cries out for attention, but deserves none.<br /><br />I was appalled by the act of violence that Cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience. He assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee.<br /><br />Some actors of quality have small parts in this film. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both make short appearances. The acting is otherwise amateur, the young men Joe and Ben are cringe making. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is creepy. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of celeb chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief. The film is never subtle and Monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action. War imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves, that acts of violence will occur within even ""civilised"" countries. This is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position, but Cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images. The female characters in the film offer no relief. They are either victims or in Manville's case a washed out mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional.<br /><br />This is Cray's first film. I listened to what he had to say during a Q and A session at Edinburugh and he is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety. The film is due to be released later this year, but I hope the company goes bust cos the public really don't need this kind of messed up material.",0,there is just one word for this film  appalling  the director clearly has talent but like his character robert carmichael he throws it all away  carmichael has potential  but like cray he cant be bothered to use it  being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is crays vision of british youth  like the british tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect  cray cries out for attention  but deserves none  i was appalled by the act of violence that cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience  he assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities  like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee  some actors of quality have small parts in this film  danny dyer and leslie manville both make short appearances  the acting is otherwise amateur  the young men joe and ben are cringe making  carmichael played by daniel spencer is creepy  miranda wilson plays monica  the attractive wife of celeb chef jonathon  michael howe   how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief  the film is never subtle and monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action  war imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves  that acts of violence will occur within even  civilised  countries  this is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position  but cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images  the female characters in the film offer no relief  they are either victims or in manvilles case a washed out mother  the community is represented as dysfunctional  this is crays first film  i listened to what he had to say during a q and a session at edinburugh and he is not unintelligent  he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety  the film is due to be released later this year  but i hope the company goes bust cos the public really dont need this kind of messed up material 
"Several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters. The shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives. All are transformed at the end of the movie. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; Her daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) is retarded and has a restricted life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife. Isabel (Ángela Molina) is a bored rich lady.<br /><br />Other characters are used to connect the five main women characters. In storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning: Some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience. The shoe-theme is driven to extremes: For example when Leire as a shoe-designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints, she breaks one of her heels.<br /><br />In editing small connections are made between the scenes. A telephone rings, a cigarette is lit, a song, etc. are used to make the connection and fast cuts. Frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching TV-levels. It is strongly music-driven to set tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories, and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters. One of the more moving shots is when Anita, who makes the same walk every day, widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road: How the restriction of space is visually translated is well done. As with most Spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually, using the soap-like stories as the simple backdrop. There is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful.<br /><br />As Ramón Salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong. Some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level, including the acting (Adela's love life, Isabel's doctor). The shoe-theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor.<br /><br />This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is more technically competent, but somewhat mechanical. This has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually. After seeing this, you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie-city: Madrid.",1,several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters  the shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives  all are transformed at the end of the movie  adela  antonia san juan  leads a brothel  her daughter anita  monica cervera  is retarded and has a restricted life  leire  najwa nimri  is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend  maricarmen  vicky peña  has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife  isabel  ángela molina  is a bored rich lady  other characters are used to connect the five main women characters  in storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning  some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience  the shoe theme is driven to extremes  for example when leire as a shoe designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints  she breaks one of her heels  in editing small connections are made between the scenes  a telephone rings  a cigarette is lit  a song  etc  are used to make the connection and fast cuts  frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching tv levels  it is strongly music driven to set tone and atmosphere  the cities of madrid and lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories  and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters  one of the more moving shots is when anita  who makes the same walk every day  widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road  how the restriction of space is visually translated is well done  as with most spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually  using the soap like stories as the simple backdrop  there is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful  as ramón salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong  some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level  including the acting  adelas love life  isabels doctor   the shoe theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor  this is often compared to magnolia because the structure is the same  but they are different  magnolia is more technically competent  but somewhat mechanical  this has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually  after seeing this  you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie city  madrid 
"In the periphery of São Paulo, the very low middle-class dysfunctional and hypocrite family of Teodoro (Giulio Lopes), Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and the teenager Soninha (Sílvia Lourenço) have deep secrets. The religious Teodoro is indeed a hit-man, hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend Waldomiro (Ailton Graça). He has a lover, the very devout woman Terezinha (Martha Meola), and he wants to regenerate, going to the country with her. Cláudia has a young lover, Júlio (Ismael de Araújo), who delivers meats for his father's butcher shop. Soninha is a common sixteen years old teenager of the periphery, having active sexual life, smoking grass and loving heavy metal. When Júlio is killed and castrated in their neighborhood, the lives of the members of the family change.<br /><br />""Contra Todos"" is a great low budget Brazilian movie that pictures the life in the periphery of a big Brazilian city. The story is very real, uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big Brazilian cities (drug dealers, hit men, fanatic religious evangelic people, hopeless teenagers etc.), has many plot points and a surprising end, and the characters have excellent performances, acting very natural and making the story totally believable. The camera follows the characters, giving a great dynamics to the film. In the Extras of the DVD, the director Roberto Moreira explains that his screenplay had no lines, only the description of the situations, and was partially disclosed only one week before the beginning of the shootings. The actors have trainings in workshops and they used lots of improvisation, being the reason for such natural acting. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Contra Todos"" (""Against Everybody"")",1,in the periphery of são paulo  the very low middle class dysfunctional and hypocrite family of teodoro  giulio lopes   cláudia  leona cavalli  and the teenager soninha  sílvia lourenço  have deep secrets  the religious teodoro is indeed a hit man  hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend waldomiro  ailton graça   he has a lover  the very devout woman terezinha  martha meola   and he wants to regenerate  going to the country with her  cláudia has a young lover  júlio  ismael de araújo   who delivers meats for his fathers butcher shop  soninha is a common sixteen years old teenager of the periphery  having active sexual life  smoking grass and loving heavy metal  when júlio is killed and castrated in their neighborhood  the lives of the members of the family change   contra todos  is a great low budget brazilian movie that pictures the life in the periphery of a big brazilian city  the story is very real  uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big brazilian cities  drug dealers  hit men  fanatic religious evangelic people  hopeless teenagers etc    has many plot points and a surprising end  and the characters have excellent performances  acting very natural and making the story totally believable  the camera follows the characters  giving a great dynamics to the film  in the extras of the dvd  the director roberto moreira explains that his screenplay had no lines  only the description of the situations  and was partially disclosed only one week before the beginning of the shootings  the actors have trainings in workshops and they used lots of improvisation  being the reason for such natural acting  my vote is eight  title  brazil    contra todos    against everybody  
"I borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating, because I wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds. As a matter of fact, they didn't - at least, so its seems. Some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie - that's it, this is what the majority of viewers think. However, the surprise comes at the end, and unfortunately then, when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie. I was also astonished when I saw that the Brazilian-Portuguese title of this movie means ""Voyage into Death"". This is THE spoiler.<br /><br />That this movie is about a young girl who goes ALONE onto this boat (on reasons that are completely unclear), you understand only in the last 5 minutes. When you start the movie with the English title ""Haunted Boat"" in your head, you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the ""ghosts"". But in reality, this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer-watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality, it is told from the perspective of the young girl. We see her not alone, but together with the four friends because SHE sees them. We do not see that she is alone. So, the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture-stream, but the main story! We have at least two parallel worlds: The world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are. An intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat.<br /><br />I cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie, the movie-makers ""cheated"" an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film-student elaborate with hastily ""chosen"" pseudo-actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers. How mistaken can one be! But in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes, the end that follows gives another surprise. The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat. When she has recovered from her shock, she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends. And there they are again! They wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore. She jumps into the water, arrives at the boat - and they are away. Miraculously beautiful. It remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a Rhetoromance writer: When I awoke, I saw Death standing at my bed. But I closed my eyes. When I opened them again - he was gone.",1,i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating  because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds  as a matter of fact  they didnt   at least  so its seems  some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie   thats it  this is what the majority of viewers think  however  the surprise comes at the end  and unfortunately then  when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie  i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilian portuguese title of this movie means  voyage into death   this is the spoiler  that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat  on reasons that are completely unclear   you understand only in the last 5 minutes  when you start the movie with the english title  haunted boat  in your head  you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the  ghosts   but in reality  this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality  it is told from the perspective of the young girl  we see her not alone  but together with the four friends because she sees them  we do not see that she is alone  so  the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture stream  but the main story  we have at least two parallel worlds  the world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are  an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat  i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie  the movie makers  cheated  an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film student elaborate with hastily  chosen  pseudo actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers  how mistaken can one be  but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes  the end that follows gives another surprise  the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat  when she has recovered from her shock  she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends  and there they are again  they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore  she jumps into the water  arrives at the boat   and they are away  miraculously beautiful  it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer  when i awoke  i saw death standing at my bed  but i closed my eyes  when i opened them again   he was gone 
"Father of the pride is a pleasant surprise: It is funny, witty and features some great voice acting. The show is about the family of a Lion who is acting as the attraction of Siegfried & Roy shows.

"Anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that I love bad movies almost as much as I love great ones, and I can honestly say that I have finally seen one of the all-time legendary bad movies: the almost indescribable mess that is MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. An adaptation of Gore Vidal's best-selling book (he later disowned this film version), the star-studded MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end. The X-rated movie about sex change operations and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it's release. Not surprisingly, the film went on to gain a near-legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema, and I was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time.<br /><br />Director Michael Sarne (who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time), took a lot of flack for the finished film, and, in honesty, it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve. The film is often incoherent, with entire sequences edited together in such a half-hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible. Also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the Fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals. This means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as Judy Garland and Shirley Temple laced into newly-film scenes of often lewd sexual acts, and the process just doesn't work as intended (this also caused a minor uproar, as actors such as Temple and Loretta Young sued the studio for using their image without permission).<br /><br />Perhaps Sarne is not the only one to blame, however, as the film's screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief. For instance, this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic Rex Reed (in his first and last major film role) could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess Raquel Welch?! The film becomes further hard to follow when Welch as Myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle (played by legendary film director John Huston), seduce a nubile female film student (Farrah Fawcett), and teach the school's resident bad boy (Roger Herren) a lesson by raping him with a strap-on dildo. Did everyone follow that? <br /><br />And it gets even better (or worse, depending upon your perspective)! I have yet to mention the film's top-billed star: the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen-thirties, Mae West! Ms. West was 77 year old when she appeared in this film (she had been retired for 26 years), and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men (including a young Tom Selleck) throwing themselves at her. As if this weren't bad enough, the tone-deaf West actually performs two newly-written songs about halfway through the film, and I think that I might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them! <br /><br />Naturally, none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as ""good,"" but I would give MYRA BRECKINRIDGE a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when I had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on. Also, most of the cast tries really hard. Raquel, in particular, appears so hell-bent in turning her poorly-written part into something meaningful that she single-handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching. If she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is also fine. The endearingly over-the-top John Huston (who really should have been directing the picture) has some funny moments, Rex Reed isn't bad for a non-actor, and Farrah Fawcett is pleasantly fresh-faced and likable. Roger Herren is also fine, but he never appeared in another movie again after this (I guess he just couldn't live down being the guy who was rapped by Raquel Welch). And as anyone could guess from the description above, Mae West was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but that's part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema.",0,anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that i love bad movies almost as much as i love great ones  and i can honestly say that i have finally seen one of the all time legendary bad movies  the almost indescribable mess that is myra breckinridge  an adaptation of gore vidals best selling book  he later disowned this film version   the star studded myra breckinridge is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end  the x rated movie about sex change operations and hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of its release  not surprisingly  the film went on to gain a near legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema  and i was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time  director michael sarne  who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time   took a lot of flack for the finished film  and  in honesty  it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve  the film is often incoherent  with entire sequences edited together in such a half hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible  also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals  this means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as judy garland and shirley temple laced into newly film scenes of often lewd sexual acts  and the process just doesnt work as intended  this also caused a minor uproar  as actors such as temple and loretta young sued the studio for using their image without permission   perhaps sarne is not the only one to blame  however  as the films screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief  for instance  this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic rex reed  in his first and last major film role  could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess raquel welch   the film becomes further hard to follow when welch as myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle  played by legendary film director john huston   seduce a nubile female film student  farrah fawcett   and teach the schools resident bad boy  roger herren  a lesson by raping him with a strap on dildo  did everyone follow that   and it gets even better  or worse  depending upon your perspective   i have yet to mention the films top billed star  the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen thirties  mae west  ms  west was 77 year old when she appeared in this film  she had been retired for 26 years   and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men  including a young tom selleck  throwing themselves at her  as if this werent bad enough  the tone deaf west actually performs two newly written songs about halfway through the film  and i think that i might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them   naturally  none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as  good   but i would give myra breckinridge a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when i had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on  also  most of the cast tries really hard  raquel  in particular  appears so hell bent in turning her poorly written part into something meaningful that she single handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching  if she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics  the rest of the cast is also fine  the endearingly over the top john huston  who really should have been directing the picture  has some funny moments  rex reed isnt bad for a non actor  and farrah fawcett is pleasantly fresh faced and likable  roger herren is also fine  but he never appeared in another movie again after this  i guess he just couldnt live down being the guy who was rapped by raquel welch   and as anyone could guess from the description above  mae west was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie   but thats part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema 
"There are movies, and there are films. Movies are more often than not merely cinematic ""candy,"" whereas films are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well-placed in the latter. As most viewers, I was highly impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what I consider to be the most sterling quality of the film. Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Deutschland, all the while in the throes of morphine addiction, die Fraulein is treated very shabbily by the German high command despite all of her efforts. The scene in which the Doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a Mercedes Benz command auto, alone, desolate, and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a ""spy's"" lot in life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the Spy Who Came in from the Cold comes close. Fraulein Doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing. I only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again and again)enjoy this exceptional motion picture.",1,there are movies  and there are films  movies are more often than not merely cinematic  candy   whereas films are true works of art  fraulein doktor is certainly well placed in the latter  as most viewers  i was highly impressed with the battle scenes  but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film  having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of deutschland  all the while in the throes of morphine addiction  die fraulein is treated very shabbily by the german high command despite all of her efforts  the scene in which the doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a mercedes benz command auto  alone  desolate  and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a  spys  lot in life  only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close  fraulein doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing  i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can  and those who have seen it can again  perhaps again and again enjoy this exceptional motion picture 
"BEGIN SPOILER: Fitfully funny and memorable for Mr. Chong's literal roach-smoking scene: Chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe's bowl, lights up, coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity,then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat, re-loads the bowl properly, re-lights, re-tokes. END SPOILER. Alas, I began to lose faith less than half-way through the proceedings. It occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable. I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners, Harold and Kumar. I simply prefer brighter company. Yet, the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble-minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they-- the former are sober.

"A never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film. The ""Blonde Wig"" half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self-indulgence by its makers.<br /><br /> The Wong Faye half (featuring a very playful, if Karen Carpenter looking, Faye Wong) holds much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the girl-meets-boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness. Character development is uneven. Emotion is missing.<br /><br /> For music lovers, Wong Faye's ""Mung Jung Yun"" (Cantonese version of the Cranberry's smash hit ""Dreams"") is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin language version called ""Zhen Tuo."" Both are on CD, although only ""Mung Jung Yun"" is found on the official movie soundtrack CD.",0,a never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film  the  blonde wig  half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self indulgence by its makers   the wong faye half  featuring a very playful  if karen carpenter looking  faye wong  holds much more appeal  all the ingredients are there  however  the girl meets boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness  character development is uneven  emotion is missing   for music lovers  wong fayes  mung jung yun   cantonese version of the cranberrys smash hit  dreams   is used effectively in chungking express  faye wong also recorded a mandarin language version called  zhen tuo   both are on cd  although only  mung jung yun  is found on the official movie soundtrack cd 
"Nobody could like this movie for its merit but, if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. It ranks up there with ""Road House"" for its preposterous characters, sets and story line. The bad writing really cracked me up: ""I want you to dust those guys off"" instead of "". . . dust those guys."" F-14s take off from the carrier but, when they get into formation, they're F-16s! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the general who, only minutes before, was overseeing a covert ""mind wipe"" on Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards. So naturally, the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too! The hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway. The little stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afganistan without refueling. Then Segal flies it back to California - the long way, i.e., by way of Europe - even though there's a carrier giving him air support 20 minutes away in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat screen TVs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls.

"I imagine Victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past, pulled down by the weight of its under-skirts. Along comes television: at its best, it has a redemptive power, and with dramatisations like those the BBC produce so finely, Victorian literature gets a new stab at life. The religious themes, the moral overtones, may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked, and acquainted with cohabitation, affairs and domestic violence. But those old, well-told stories have enduring power, and this is one's a hidden gem.<br /><br />It's hard to gauge today just how forceful, feminist and extraordinary Ann Bronte's masterpiece, ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"", actually was. Emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily, mental, societal  her heroine, Helen Huntingdon, escapes a miserable marriage, flees brutality and alcoholism, braves not only her abusive husband's fury, but society's pinched intolerance and malicious gossip, to wreak change in her life. She pays a price; but retains her self-respect; she falls in love along the way; she emerges battered but victorious, and strong. I just love watching women like these on screen.<br /><br />The actors are superb  the best Brits have to offer. The love story is beautifully handled, with real passion and feeling by well-matched actors. Tara Fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine, and as has been said here by other reviewers, no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle. Toby Stephens, striking sparks off her, contributes just the right combination of headstrong, handsome youth and passionate, yearning vulnerability. Rupert Graves (one of my favourite British actors ever) enjoys himself as the charismatic villain (so much so that you're almost with him at the end. No one's perfect). The supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes, and without having felt preached to. Another BBC classic, highly recommended: this is how romantic literature should be dramatised.",1,i imagine victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past  pulled down by the weight of its under skirts  along comes television  at its best  it has a redemptive power  and with dramatisations like those the bbc produce so finely  victorian literature gets a new stab at life  the religious themes  the moral overtones  may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked  and acquainted with cohabitation  affairs and domestic violence  but those old  well told stories have enduring power  and this is ones a hidden gem  its hard to gauge today just how forceful  feminist and extraordinary ann brontes masterpiece   the tenant of wildfell hall   actually was  emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily  mental  societal  her heroine  helen huntingdon  escapes a miserable marriage  flees brutality and alcoholism  braves not only her abusive husbands fury  but societys pinched intolerance and malicious gossip  to wreak change in her life  she pays a price  but retains her self respect  she falls in love along the way  she emerges battered but victorious  and strong  i just love watching women like these on screen  the actors are superb  the best brits have to offer  the love story is beautifully handled  with real passion and feeling by well matched actors  tara fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine  and as has been said here by other reviewers  no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle  toby stephens  striking sparks off her  contributes just the right combination of headstrong  handsome youth and passionate  yearning vulnerability  rupert graves  one of my favourite british actors ever  enjoys himself as the charismatic villain  so much so that youre almost with him at the end  no ones perfect   the supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes  and without having felt preached to  another bbc classic  highly recommended  this is how romantic literature should be dramatised 
"Hooper is Not Funny, Not Fasted paced, Not romantic and Non informative. There is no real drama. You would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama, there was an attempt but it didn't seem real. No Character study, no lessons learned, it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun, they were just trying to act like they were having fun. There is no reason to watch unless you like to look at Burt and want get an occasional glimpse of Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do.

"Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian hit-man or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers do not agree.In terms of content, this highly enjoyable action movie doesn't have one; in terms of sheer amusement, it is funit is very melodramatic, violent, quite brutal, the car chases are notable. ""Arzenta"" is an unpretentious ,yet very likable filmmuch better than the current Hollywoodian trash that gets the same label. It comes from Delon's rather short flirting with the Italian B cinema of the '70s. It carefully uses Delon's tough guy persona, belonging to the gallery of bad-ass thugs that he made in his youth. <br /><br />I enjoyed very much the fact that Delon made this film, that he had a role in a good Eurocrime flick.<br /><br />The score is very fine, with a good introductory songmaking felt that gusto that the Italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work,where the musical art has an important part.<br /><br />In Tony Arzenta/ Big Guns/ No Way Out the very appealing Erika Blanc (31 years in '73) appears as an unnamed hooker.Meanwhile, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra,is played by Carla Gravina (a starlet that practically left the movies after '75).<br /><br />""Arzenta"" is interestingly filmedan ambitious visual conception, some Expressionistic peculiar angles. The movie was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari,the one who made also Zorro (the Delon comedy).Needless to mention that these two films,Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro ,are very unlike.The first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie--the second is a lighthearted comedy,more kindred to a spoof,though remarkably coherent and skilfully made.Duccio Tessari directed films like Kiss Kiss... Bang Bang (1966),Sons of Satan ,The Bloodstained Butterfly ,¡Viva La Muerte...

"This was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting (mainly from the supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself...<br /><br />Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool.

"Very slow-paced, but intricately structured and ultimately very touching. A nice, very true-to-life look at a small Florida beach town in the dead of winter -- I've been there, and this is absolutely accurate.<br /><br />It's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe this film is 12 years old -- I remember seeing it in theaters, and I recently rented ""Ruby"" again. Except for the 80's looking clothes, it has held up very nicely. Ashely is so radiant and touching here, that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing. Boy, talk about failing to fulfill your early promise! Anyone seeing Ashley here in ""Ruby In Paradise"" would assume this elegant, natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting -- instead she has become the ""go to"" girl for dumb action films and slasher movies! Very disappointing, but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise.<br /><br />As some other commenter's say, this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced. This is not an action film, nor is it really a romance. The director (Victor Nunez, ""Ulees Gold"", another excellent character study) treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect, allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail. In that way, I think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming-of-age stories about young women that I can recall -- it's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or ""how she lost her virginity"", but about her life choices and her growing maturity.<br /><br />A lovely film, if you take the time to watch it...I think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls (or boys for that matter) and give them a chance to think about and discuss it.<br /><br />Particular kudos to director Nunez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and nicely detailed that I assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female-written novel or memoir, but in fact it's Mr. Nunez's original work.

"I loved this film, seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen! The audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things, and the fast pace was most enjoyable.<br /><br />I do, as a singer and musical director, question one section of Roby Keeler's vocal in ""By a Waterfall."" The key modulated, and she was suddenly singing much lower, in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin-like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals.<br /><br />Does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer?

"First off, this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the Sci-Fi Channel has produced; that isn't to say that Grendel is a good film, in fact, it is very bad, but it definitely had potential to be a lot better. The flaws of the film come from character design, character, absurd additions to the story, the visual effects, the music, and for the most part: the acting.<br /><br />When speaking of character design, I, of course, mean the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous Vikings, rather than warriors of brute strength -- that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly. Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange tentacle-attachments to his elbows.<br /><br />The characters are very limited. Beowulf is same from beginning to end, however Finn -- a useless sidekick -- achieved some two-dimensionality, due thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth gets some notion as well, as he becomes less conceited.<br /><br />Much like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it its own, while still holding to the source material. The crossbow that is gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous, I'm surprised the cast didn't walk off the set. Besides additions, there's omissions, such as the underlying themes of Christianity and Paganism, as well as the consequences of lying.<br /><br />The special effects are mighty terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived, and as such, they're portrayal on screen is less than believable.<br /><br />The music is overbearing, especially when a character dies.<br /><br />All in all, this is not Sci-Fi's worst film to date. No. It is actually one of the better films, though trash it still it is, it is good trash, making it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wooden here and there.<br /><br />I highly recommend you skip this film and watch Robert Zemeckis' take on the ancient story of Beowulf, simply because this film (Grendel) is only half the tale, and not the whole thing, which garners this movie a three-star review.",0,first off  this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the sci fi channel has produced  that isnt to say that grendel is a good film  in fact  it is very bad  but it definitely had potential to be a lot better  the flaws of the film come from character design  character  absurd additions to the story  the visual effects  the music  and for the most part  the acting  when speaking of character design  i  of course  mean the way our heroes and villains look  beowulf and the other danes seem like ridiculous vikings  rather than warriors of brute strength    that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly  grendel looks like the hulk but with strange tentacle attachments to his elbows  the characters are very limited  beowulf is same from beginning to end  however finn    a useless sidekick    achieved some two dimensionality  due thanks to his romantic subplot  and unferth gets some notion as well  as he becomes less conceited  much like finn  there are useless additions to this story to make it its own  while still holding to the source material  the crossbow that is gifted to beowulf is so ridiculous  im surprised the cast didnt walk off the set  besides additions  theres omissions  such as the underlying themes of christianity and paganism  as well as the consequences of lying  the special effects are mighty terrible  grendel and his mother hag are poorly conceived  and as such  theyre portrayal on screen is less than believable  the music is overbearing  especially when a character dies  all in all  this is not sci fis worst film to date  no  it is actually one of the better films  though trash it still it is  it is good trash  making it a guilty pleasure at best  the only thing that works is the dialogue  which is still wooden here and there  i highly recommend you skip this film and watch robert zemeckis take on the ancient story of beowulf  simply because this film  grendel  is only half the tale  and not the whole thing  which garners this movie a three star review 
"I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre. It was actually sold out. I actually went to see Solaris instead, which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, streetwise 'street pharmacist', freaks out when he sees a kid get shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards).

"In THE FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard . Or is it Travis Bickle ? or Rupert Pupkin ? Or Max Cady ? You see the problem with this type of role is that De Niro has played very very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER , THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts . I found it slightly difficult to believe that Renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho<br /><br />The character arc isn't the only problem with this script - It also lacks a character focus ( A problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat ) , for several stretches of the movie I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to Renard . It also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball . I'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should focus upon <br /><br />I will admit I was entertained by THE FAN ( Especially by the soundtrack ) but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s characters being stalked by nutters as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE , UNLAWFUL ENTRY etc had run out of steam a long time ago",0,in the fan robert de niro plays gil renard   or is it travis bickle   or rupert pupkin   or max cady   you see the problem with this type of role is that de niro has played very very similar characters in taxi driver   the king of comedy and cape fear and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts   i found it slightly difficult to believe that renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho the character arc isnt the only problem with this script   it also lacks a character focus   a problem i had with the untouchables where de niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat     for several stretches of the movie i kept thinking that bobby rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to renard   it also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball   im not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should focus upon  i will admit i was entertained by the fan   especially by the soundtrack   but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s characters being stalked by nutters as in single white female   unlawful entry etc had run out of steam a long time ago
"One of the all-time great science fiction works, as visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here, but he's outdone by Pitt's incredibly frenetic turn that's unlike anything he's done before or since. Even Stowe isn't out of her league here, though. The story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about. The climactic scene is beautifully magnificent, and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. Lots of dark humour on display here. Fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.",1,one of the all time great science fiction works  as visionary and thought provoking as blade runner or even gilliams own brazil  willis gives his best performance here  but hes outdone by pitts incredibly frenetic turn thats unlike anything hes done before or since  even stowe isnt out of her league here  though  the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about  the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent  and the last lines fit perfectly  the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way  lots of dark humour on display here  fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography  in my top ten 
"This is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong. A simple robbery. Pick up some serious change. Get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory. Butmom and pop's jewelry store? No problem. Insurance pays for it all. No guns. Nobody gets hurt. Easy money.<br /><br />Older, more successful (it would appear) brother Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) has a few minor problems. Heroin addiction, cocaine habituation. A wife (Marisa Tomei) thatwell, he can't seem to perform for. His flat belly days long gone. Younger, sweet, slightly dim-witted younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke) with a few dinero problems of his own. Behind in child support payments for his daughter, in debt to friends and relatives, not exactly wowing them in the work of work, etc.<br /><br />Sydney Lumet, in this performance at the age of 82 (!), directs and gets it 99.99 percent right, which is hard to do in a thriller. I have seen more thrillers than I can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes, the improbabilities, the cheesy scenes, and the hurry-up ending. Here Lumet makes a thriller like it's a work of art. Every detail is perfect. The acting is superb. The plot has no holes. The story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the Bard himself.<br /><br />Hoffman of course is excellent. When you don't have marquee, leading man presence, you have to get by on talent, workmanship and pure concentration. Ethan Hawke, who is no stranger to the sweet, little guy role, adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don't know whether to pity him or trash him. Albert Finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age. And Marisa Tomei, who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity, manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as Andy's two timing wife. (But who could blame her?) It's almost a movie reviewer's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars, but if you study this film, as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do, you will notice the kind of excessive (according to most Hollywood producers) attention to detail that makes for real art--the sort of thing that only great artists can do, and indeed cannot help but do. (By the way, I think there were twenty producers on this filmwell, maybe a dozen; check the credits.) All I can say in summation is, Way to go Sydney Lumet, author of a slew of excellent films, and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced agekudos. May we all do half so well.<br /><br />Okay, the 00.01 percent. It was unlikely that the father (Albert Finney) could have followed the cabs that Andy took around New York without somehow losing the tail. This is minor, and I wish all thrillers could have so small a blip. Also one wonders why Lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of Hank at the end. We can guess and guess. Perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor. Perhaps Lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out, and he just said, ""Leave it like that. It really doesn't matter."" And I think it doesn't. What happens to Hank is not going to be good. He isn't the kind of guy who manages to run off to Mexico and is able to start a new life. He is the kind of guy who gets a ""light"" sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn't really a man when he should have been.<br /><br />See this for Sidney Lumet, one of Hollywood's best, director of The Pawnbroker (1964), The Group (1966), Serpico (1973), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Network (1976), and many more.",1,this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong  a simple robbery  pick up some serious change  get our finances together and everything will be hunky dory  butmom and pops jewelry store  no problem  insurance pays for it all  no guns  nobody gets hurt  easy money  older  more successful  it would appear  brother andy  philip seymour hoffman  has a few minor problems  heroin addiction  cocaine habituation  a wife  marisa tomei  thatwell  he cant seem to perform for  his flat belly days long gone  younger  sweet  slightly dim witted younger brother  hank  ethan hawke  with a few dinero problems of his own  behind in child support payments for his daughter  in debt to friends and relatives  not exactly wowing them in the work of work  etc  sydney lumet  in this performance at the age of 82      directs and gets it 99 99 percent right  which is hard to do in a thriller  i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes  the improbabilities  the cheesy scenes  and the hurry up ending  here lumet makes a thriller like its a work of art  every detail is perfect  the acting is superb  the plot has no holes  the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself  hoffman of course is excellent  when you dont have marquee  leading man presence  you have to get by on talent  workmanship and pure concentration  ethan hawke  who is no stranger to the sweet  little guy role  adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we dont know whether to pity him or trash him  albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age  and marisa tomei  who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity  manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andys two timing wife   but who could blame her   its almost a movie reviewers sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars  but if you study this film  as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do  you will notice the kind of excessive  according to most hollywood producers  attention to detail that makes for real art  the sort of thing that only great artists can do  and indeed cannot help but do   by the way  i think there were twenty producers on this filmwell  maybe a dozen  check the credits   all i can say in summation is  way to go sydney lumet  author of a slew of excellent films  and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced agekudos  may we all do half so well  okay  the 00 01 percent  it was unlikely that the father  albert finney  could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail  this is minor  and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip  also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end  we can guess and guess  perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor  perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out  and he just said   leave it like that  it really doesnt matter   and i think it doesnt  what happens to hank is not going to be good  he isnt the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life  he is the kind of guy who gets a  light  sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasnt really a man when he should have been  see this for sidney lumet  one of hollywoods best  director of the pawnbroker  1964   the group  1966   serpico  1973   dog day afternoon  1975   network  1976   and many more

"My all-time favorite movie. Oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. It is Josie Lawrence's best work by far, and transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright. Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I can find no fault in it. The music, by famed composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel.",1,my all time favorite movie  oscar caliber work by everyone involved  both in front of and behind the camera  the screenplay is perfect  and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way  unlike the novel  the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes  and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment  it is josie lawrences best work by far  and transformed my opinion of joan plowright  having watched this movie at least 50 times  i can find no fault in it  the music  by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel 
"Even if you're a huge Sandler fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy! I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover). Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of his home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we (the audience) are left to dry. This is hardly a ""movie""! Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is ""no-budget"" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie). So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience. And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line ""Take my wife, please"" and the audience is on the floor? I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here. Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in ""Billy Madison,"" the midget in ""Happy Gilmore's"" Happy Place) but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested. You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in ""Mixed Nuts."" Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane (""Titanic"") has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the ""Rocky"" movies) has a significant role. <br /><br />This awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so. <br /><br />My score: 3 (out of 10)",0,even if youre a huge sandler fan  please dont bother with this extremely disappointing comedy  i bought this movie for  7 99  assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked  judging by the r rating and scantily clad women on the cover   well  there are quite a few scantily clad women  but none get naked  im not sure what point this was in sandlers career  but im guessing it was even before his snl days  i can be wrong  this is like watching one of his home movies  he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol times   but we  the audience  are left to dry  this is hardly a  movie   sandler does a lot of talking to the camera  and even admits at one point that this is  no budget  movie  thats right  not a low budget movie  a no budget movie   so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters  there is no steady plot  its like an extended sketch comedy show  but a crude and badly written one  that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience  and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line  take my wife  please  and the audience is on the floor  im not even going to try to make any logic here  sure  sandlers current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense  the penguin in  billy madison   the midget in  happy gilmores  happy place  but the comedy works  this is a strictly amateurish work  and even if youre curious about adams early days in film  you still wont be interested  youre better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in  mixed nuts   of course  the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle  billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance  billy zane   titanic   has a supporting role and the great burt young  from the  rocky  movies  has a significant role   this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99 cent rental section of your local video store  and rightfully so   my score  3  out of 10

"I had fun watching Red Eye. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven gave it a good pace. At least not another Scream with the usual college killer. It's nice when you can see a clean, coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character. Particularly from a film-maker like Craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie had it not been released theatrically.

"After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The journey was 23 years, but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it... let say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, ""journey is more important than the destination"". Unbelievable.

"What an extraordinary crime thriller!! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival. It's already my second favourite film of all-time after DR. STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions. A synopsis that I'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke, are planning to rob a jewellery store in Westchester, New York. The film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time (before, during and after the robbery), and one key scene is repeated at least three times. Ordinarily, that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece. The excitement, the tension, and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed. By the end, I was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up. I know that I've used a few clichés in this post, but I literally was on the edge of my seat. I should mention that the non-linear storyline is quite easy to follow. This isn't the sort of movie where you'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely brilliant all-around, and I doubt I would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn't been so perfect. A tiny complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke don't look like brothers, but that's a minor quibble that I can easily overlook. Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric. Marisa Tomei (as Hoffman's wife) and Albert Finney (as the father of Hoffman & Hawke) are also very good in supporting roles. Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every remark, gesture and facial expression by Brian O'Byrne and Michael Shannon  absolute perfection. The robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene I've ever watched, and I had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes, especially the ones with Hoffman. The music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie, often the same notes played over very effectively. I had the music playing in my head the following day, even as I sat through other films. In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph, there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable (major spoiler, so I can't describe the scene). Otherwise, this film is pretty darn close to perfect.<br /><br />There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD stands in a league of its own. As an aside, the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage. Tomei didn't speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked ""Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy?"" That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene!!",1,what an extraordinary crime thriller   my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival  its already my second favourite film of all time after dr  strangelove and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my wife  i dont want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions  a synopsis that id feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers  played by phillip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke  are planning to rob a jewellery store in westchester  new york  the film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time  before  during and after the robbery   and one key scene is repeated at least three times  ordinarily  that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece  the excitement  the tension  and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed  by the end  i was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up  i know that ive used a few clichés in this post  but i literally was on the edge of my seat  i should mention that the non linear storyline is quite easy to follow  this isnt the sort of movie where youll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie  the acting is absolutely brilliant all around  and i doubt i would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadnt been so perfect  a tiny complaint is that hoffman and hawke dont look like brothers  but thats a minor quibble that i can easily overlook  hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with hawke were positively electric  marisa tomei  as hoffmans wife  and albert finney  as the father of hoffman   hawke  are also very good in supporting roles  even some cameo performances were so impressive that i can still remember every remark  gesture and facial expression by brian obyrne and michael shannon  absolute perfection  the robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene ive ever watched  and i had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes  especially the ones with hoffman  the music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie  often the same notes played over very effectively  i had the music playing in my head the following day  even as i sat through other films  in addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph  there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable  major spoiler  so i cant describe the scene   otherwise  this film is pretty darn close to perfect  there were about a dozen great films at the festival that i would enjoy watching a second time but before the devil knows youre dead stands in a league of its own  as an aside  the director sidney lumet spoke before the film and he introduced marisa tomei and ethan hawke onto the stage  tomei didnt speak and she acted a bit shy so lumet asked  can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera shy   that comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene  
"If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast. The film is a grotesque, erotic, fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological 'Beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a French mansion and lusts after women. The film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. The theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, I might add; but the film conveys it; straight and to the point. Like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre, The Beast could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps, but Borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.<br /><br />The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female. This opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience, in some ways, for the incredible, tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see. The scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking, and are bound to offend many people (hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for Borowczyk to shock the viewer; this film has a defining point. As said during the film; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence. Both man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them. The Beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire, and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast. The film has strong themes of the age-old story of 'beauty and beast' weaved into it, and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust, but not without a moral.<br /><br />Many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story. Without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of 'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame. Besides that, Borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.<br /><br />Overall, The Beast is a shocking film. It's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. However, if you can get over the film's shock, and embrace The Beast; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance.",1,if  like me  you like your films to be unique  and unlike the majority of other movies  then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast  the film is a grotesque  erotic  fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological beast that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women  the film is very daring with its subject material  and that is something to give it credit for  the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo  and for good reason  i might add  but the film conveys it  straight and to the point  like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre  the beast could have gone around it  and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps  but borowczyk didnt do that  and he is brave in that respect  especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms  but the fact that he went ahead with it  in my view  means a big thumbs up for the guy  the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female  this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience  in some ways  for the incredible  tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see  the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking  and are bound to offend many people  hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years   but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer  this film has a defining point  as said during the film  the only difference between man and beast is intelligence  both man and beast have instincts  only man knows how to control them  the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality  the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire  and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast  the film has strong themes of the age old story of beauty and beast weaved into it  and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust  but not without a moral  many criticise the scenes around the films shocking sex sequences for being boring  but these scenes are important to the films story  without these scenes  we wouldnt get to know the characters or the story of the beast  and  most importantly  the story of beauty and the beast would not be able to have its horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience  and as that is one of the key elements of the film  it would be a real shame  besides that  borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes  not with shocks  but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family  along with the beautiful shots of the mansions ground would not be seen  and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either  overall  the beast is a shocking film  its portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone  however  if you can get over the films shock  and embrace the beast  what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance 
"This movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend. There are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here. The actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty. Maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types. The Australian coast scenery is, simply, splendid to see. What a place to visit, to say the least, and one day it may become my hideaway. I really enjoy this movie and every time I watch it I enjoy it more. I would love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what became of them. Although the plot is somewhat soft, this movie is, of course, a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories.",1,this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend  there are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here  the actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty  maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types  the australian coast scenery is  simply  splendid to see  what a place to visit  to say the least  and one day it may become my hideaway  i really enjoy this movie and every time i watch it i enjoy it more  i would love to see more of these characters and i always wonder what became of them  although the plot is somewhat soft  this movie is  of course  a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories 
"Payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later. Why would a man become involved with the trophy wife of a ruthless mob boss in the gangster's own mansion with suspicious henchmen all around? Why would an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to carry her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love? Surely the hero, here Kevin Costner, must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband that gives the movie an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence. Anthony Quinn, great actor that he was, surely deserved better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she latches on to her prince charming. Stowe is okay but her Spanish accent doesn't work. The cameos of the lesser players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star.",0,payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later  why would a man become involved with the trophy wife of a ruthless mob boss in the gangsters own mansion with suspicious henchmen all around  why would an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to carry her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love  surely the hero  here kevin costner  must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband that gives the movie an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence  anthony quinn  great actor that he was  surely deserved better  and madeleine stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she latches on to her prince charming  stowe is okay but her spanish accent doesnt work  the cameos of the lesser players are good  especially miguel ferrer and john leguizamo and sally kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star 
"I was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. It is brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. He's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film transcends into a dark film noir, with a couple of truly excellent scenes, and an even better finale. The real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability. The use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film. It's the sort of film Hollywood really wants to make, but just can't.",1,i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute  it is brilliantly shot  with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed  the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike  she hires an assistant at work  with her true intention being to find love  hes an ex con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her  in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off  the film transcends into a dark film noir  with a couple of truly excellent scenes  and an even better finale  the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading characters disability  the use of sound keeps the tension consistent  and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping  thats for sure  throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression youve got the makings of a great film  its the sort of film hollywood really wants to make  but just cant 
"This film is a complete re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus. The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus. There is a border between them, and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs. The situation is bleak enough. We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap. But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay, Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus. To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv. It is off limits in Nablus. The conflict between the two peoples, the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures, two ethics. But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension. Ashraf's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus. Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay. She cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later. From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack. It takes place in a café in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noam's is severely wounded. Bad enough. The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack, but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street. The funeral follows the wedding. The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack. Ashraf volunteers to take his place. The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister. He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noam's. But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him. Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street. The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death. We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona, a neutral character that can impose peace, or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel. The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides. But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film, a play that shows love in Auschwitz, between two prisoners, one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle. This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking: gay love in Auschwitz. What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible. The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on. We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago. Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated. This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution. But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations. So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden, of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on: so let's procreate more and more little soldiers. But love is just an extra-terrestrial concept.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",1,this film is a complete re imagining of romeo and juliet in tel aviv and nablus  the lovers are one from tel aviv et the other from nablus  there is a border between them  and a constant state of war with the israeli army ever present everywhere and the palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs  the situation is bleak enough  we can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap  but the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay  noam from tel aviv and ashraf from nablus  to be gay is accepted in tel aviv  it is off limits in nablus  the conflict between the two peoples  the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures  two ethics  but this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension  ashrafs sister is going to get married to a militant activist in nablus  ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay  she cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later  from the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into tel aviv to set up a bomb attack  it takes place in a café in tel aviv and one friend of noams is severely wounded  bad enough  the isareli army sends a commando to nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack  but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street  the funeral follows the wedding  the husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack  ashraf volunteers to take his place  the exiled lover comes back to tel aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister  he arrives at a diner managed by some friends of noams  but noam sees him and gets out to speak to him  ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when noam reaches him in the street  the vengeance reunites the two lovers in death  we thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the prince of verona  a neutral character that can impose peace  or even worse the prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of israel  the game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides  but the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film  a play that shows love in auschwitz  between two prisoners  one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle  this is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking  gay love in auschwitz  what comes out of the film is that over there in tel aviv or nablus love is impossible  the film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on  we should never have let great britain deal with the region a long time ago  today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated  this will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution  but so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations  so suffering will go on and love will be forbidden  of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on  so lets procreate more and more little soldiers  but love is just an extra terrestrial concept  dr jacques coulardeau  university paris dauphine   university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne

"I know, I know: it's childish. But I just love this type of movie. A bird that suffered a lot of ""mishaps"" and still hasn't lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor. What's special about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie -the parrot- and he's not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor. Furthermore I like the storyline: Paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice almost sounds like Joe Pesci's!). And Cheech Marin of course, the man IS humor to me. Ever since I saw ""Up in Smoke"" I have appreciated his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a hilarious one.. can't help myself.",1,i know  i know  its childish  but i just love this type of movie  a bird that suffered a lot of  mishaps  and still hasnt lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor  whats special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie  the parrot  and hes not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor  furthermore i like the storyline  paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom   by the way  jay mohrs voice almost sounds like joe pescis    and cheech marin of course  the man is humor to me  ever since i saw  up in smoke  i have appreciated his naive way of performing  making a simple situation a hilarious one   cant help myself 
"Shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage. But when this stage is Israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style. Dan Katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but besides, Katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the Israeli people and, this people, far from being simple prominent figures, they speak to us from the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live, and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes. It is very great for me because the reality of state of Israel, which the Europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers, appears as a close and absolutly human reality, the reality of million people who looking for his place, exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it. Katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thank you Dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world.",1,shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage  but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style  dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv  but besides  katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and  this people  far from being simple prominent figures  they speak to us from the heart  katzirs film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live  and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes  it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel  which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers  appears as a close and absolutly human reality  the reality of million people who looking for his place  exploring the whole state  the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it  katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force  and these feelings cross our hearts  thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world

"Because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot, I'd like to mention a few points about this film. There may be spoilers here; I don't care enough to filter them out.<br /><br />- Given the film's low budget, the creature design was quite good. It's actually nice to see a direct-to-video horror film that's not slathered with awful CGI. Unfortunately the digital film quality's quite grainy in places, and it's most noticeable in the well-lit white halls of the asylum.<br /><br />- Ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film, to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time. I understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia, but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established. As-is, it merely seems amateurish.<br /><br />- Plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable. I neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists, nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil-trumps-good development would surface at the end.<br /><br />- This may seem like quibbling, but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense. First of all, regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest-induced. Why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies? Why wasn't a plot point made of these impressive qualifications, or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion? What's the background? What's supposed to make us care about anyone in this? And just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place, see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it, and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency? This film didn't even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Bottom line: See The Wicker Man instead.",0,because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot  id like to mention a few points about this film  there may be spoilers here  i dont care enough to filter them out    given the films low budget  the creature design was quite good  its actually nice to see a direct to video horror film thats not slathered with awful cgi  unfortunately the digital film qualitys quite grainy in places  and its most noticeable in the well lit white halls of the asylum    ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film  to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time  i understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia  but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established  as is  it merely seems amateurish    plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable  i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists  nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil trumps good development would surface at the end    this may seem like quibbling  but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense  first of all  regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest induced  why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies  why wasnt a plot point made of these impressive qualifications  or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion  whats the background  whats supposed to make us care about anyone in this  and just as importantly  who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place  see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it  and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency  this film didnt even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt  bottom line  see the wicker man instead

"Documenting a documenter. That's one way to describe Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale. This film follows anthropologist Tobias Schneebaum, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to West Papua and then Peru. Tobias is a full-bodied character: a gay Jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for. Author of several books documenting his time with both the Asmat people of West Papua and the cannibalistic Amazonians in Peru, Tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become. Yet Tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch. One can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves.<br /><br />Tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed. This film challenges the notions of morality and ""naturalness""- e.g. nudity, homosexuality, cannibalism. (Watch for the graphic circumcision scene). When questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce, his non-judgmental nature asks: ""Why Not?"" Who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? This little sleeper is a must watch for not only National Geographic types, but also those interested in the art of documentary making. This film shows what can be done shot on video. The editing provides a quiet revelation of Tobias' life that leaves you watching in fascination. At times, he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back, especially considering his age and physical frailty. We can be but grateful that Tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself, perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world. The filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance, presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that Tobias predetermined his findings (of homosexuality in this case) based on his personal interests. That said, you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle.

"I'm a big fan of B5, having caught on only at the end of season three. I faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought out story arcs to ever hit television. Even the filler episodes were interesting. The movies, also, were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters.<br /><br />Which brings us to 'River of Souls'. Naturally, after seeing everything else, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen appears to be acting in an Ed Wood movie rather than a serious Sci-Fi story. The story itself, might have looked good in outline form, even made it to the story board. However, it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie. There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. There are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out. Had this made the regular season, it would have rated among the worst of the episodes.",0,im a big fan of b5  having caught on only at the end of season three  i faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated  concluding that it was one of the most well thought out story arcs to ever hit television  even the filler episodes were interesting  the movies  also  were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters  which brings us to river of souls  naturally  after seeing everything else  i had high expectations  martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci fi story  the story itself  might have looked good in outline form  even made it to the story board  however  it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie  there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story  there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out  had this made the regular season  it would have rated among the worst of the episodes 
"I ran across this movie at the local video store during their yearly sidewalk sale. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale, I came across this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew it was God's hand at work for me to purchase this movie. You see, I have a sibling group of three foster (and soon to be adopted) children living with my family. Immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie. The movie helped them better understand their own circumstances. For the first time, also, the oldest of the sibling group (7 year old/female) decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced. She has been fighting the entire trust issue. This is also the first time I had seen her cry. After watching the film, I asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted. She replied, ""It means to be happy."" A must see for families who are fostering children and are considering adoption. It certainly opened the lines of communication with us.",1,i ran across this movie at the local video store during their yearly sidewalk sale  while scanning thousands of videos  hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale  i came across this movie  i read the back of the movie and knew it was gods hand at work for me to purchase this movie  you see  i have a sibling group of three foster  and soon to be adopted  children living with my family  immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie  the movie helped them better understand their own circumstances  for the first time  also  the oldest of the sibling group  7 year old female  decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced  she has been fighting the entire trust issue  this is also the first time i had seen her cry  after watching the film  i asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted  she replied   it means to be happy   a must see for families who are fostering children and are considering adoption  it certainly opened the lines of communication with us 
"The first part, Che in Cuba, is about that portion of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded (remember that Che was a physician). It ends as Castro wins the revolution; Che never gets to Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is about guess what. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded.<br /><br />When I realized this was supposed to be an ""epic"" (I never knew *anything* but the title before it started), I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. More of that later.<br /><br />Not to be a racist, but aside from what I've already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are, well, indistinguishable -- unknown Hispanic actors who look alike, especially considering they all wear ""Che"" beards and all wear Che fatigues. This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very minor role). While del Toro's terrific, think of ""Lawrence"" with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character: no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea.<br /><br />Because the other characters are interchangeable, this results in a loss of reference. When top aides of Che are killed, you feel no remorse since you don't know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I don't think that's a spoiler), there's no empathy from the audience -- he's just killed.<br /><br />He's too one-dimensional to relate to as a human being. Aside from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude, the only thing we learn about Che is that he's married with five children (he tells another character that near the end). What was his motivation? A complete enigma.<br /><br />Maybe Soderbergh is purposely aping Lean. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence, the mystery man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn). He was as courageous as he was insecure -- i.e., had human qualities. Che is like a machine, about as warm as The Terminator.<br /><br />Earlier this year there was another war epic, Mongol.

"Hmmm...where to start? How does a serious actress like Demi Moore got involved in such crap? ""First blood"" might be rated as bull***t but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, point. Of course if you are interested in the crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals) that is the most stupid cliché one I can think of, you'll say ""GI Jane"" is a great movie. Just the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable but hell, I can't think of Demi Moore being Rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott doesn't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights, it's just brainless propaganda for the American army and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore in it.

"Such a long awaited movie.. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day.. From the trailers it looked like a action movie, but it turned out to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, they've done their part of the movie very well. Good acting, but i don't think that can save the movie.. India has been shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-)<br /><br />Action sequences were shot very shabbily, no one could make out head & tail of the stunts, they've used Akki(akshay kumar) very well but could've been done much much better..<br /><br />Animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies(90's movies had better animation scenes i guess(initial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake).<br /><br />And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins, just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess..",0,such a long awaited movie   but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day   from the trailers it looked like a action movie  but it turned out to be a out   out comedy a bad comedy   but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors  theyve done their part of the movie very well  good acting  but i dont think that can save the movie   india has been shot beautifully  kerala  rajasthan   ladakh   were all saturated with color  alright  nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there     action sequences were shot very shabbily  no one could make out head   tail of the stunts  theyve used akki akshay kumar  very well but couldve been done much much better   animation is the worst ive seen in recent movies 90s movies had better animation scenes i guess initial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lake   and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins  just to make sure audiences dont forget the movie name i guess  
"What an awful movie! The Idea of robots fighting each other is cool, but the storyline is ridiculous, real human action laughable, acting non-existent and special effects (on which, this type of movie must depend) are archaic. I thought it must have been made around '80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990. That's 5 years after Aliens! OK, lots of people said it was good considering the low budget, but I just think 'what's the point?'. it looks totally unbelievable. I wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re-written story because I still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other.",0,what an awful movie  the idea of robots fighting each other is cool  but the storyline is ridiculous  real human action laughable  acting non existent and special effects  on which  this type of movie must depend  are archaic  i thought it must have been made around 80 84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990  thats 5 years after aliens  ok  lots of people said it was good considering the low budget  but i just think whats the point   it looks totally unbelievable  i wouldnt mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re written story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other 
"Recherche is a good word to describe this movie.<br /><br />Let's say every movie has a selling point, a gimmick. Transformers' gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia. Sleepless in Seattle's gimmick is situational in their tag-line, ""What if someone you never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only someone for you?"" Many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names. Leap Years employs both by using the Irish folklore as the circumstance and featuring considerably famous names within the country.<br /><br />So now that the audience are in the cinema, besides all the usual elements in characters, conflict or consequences, crisis, resolve and denouement, they also look forward to stimulating dialog, more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years, interesting sub-plots and perhaps, to a certain extent, a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters.<br /><br />This is what Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve. If they've tried to, their goal was apparently in the other court, at the other stadium, on the other end of the planet. She and her writer, Alain Layrac, utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog. Most of the lines were contrived. It seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie: ""Okay, these are the lines and quotes which I've heard or read from either movies I've seen or books I've read before and they all sound good to me. If they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience. Therefore, all i have to do is piece them all together. I am going to use all of them."" The result is cathartic. I can't say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on, but they seem to spring out of nowhere, catching you off guard with these quotable quotes.<br /><br />On a personal level, i know people who cite quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog, trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding along. I don't go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming.<br /><br />Secondly, the characters portrayed are silly and one-dimensional. With exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation (necessary to drive the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. I haven't an idea who they are. They are all simpletons spouting lines from the advice column of a female-oriented magazine.<br /><br />The gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow. Then again, there are movies with less but fared better than this, aren't there. They made it up with my first and second point. Moreover, the sub-plots are inconsequential (not that it's a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing).<br /><br />Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to attain the approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography, soundtrack and filming location. These non-discerning viewers.<br /><br />It is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it's good. It is just bad.

"This movie really is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story and concept of the movie are really good, tense and have some nice plot twists in it. But than again on the other hand, it all is told very slow, without style and uninvolved. Still I regard ""Just Cause"" as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast.<br /><br />Maybe Sean Connery was miscast in his role. I mean, he isn't really that believable as a the main 'hero' and father of a young daughter (played by a still very young Scarlett Johansson by the way) and husband of Kate Capshaw. I feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it. However Sean Connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does. But he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time, which is a real shame, as well as a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. He's truly chilling and acting superbly. Normally he doesn't play this ruthless, chilling sort of roles in movies, so he really surprises with his role in this one. His performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie. However due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic, none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant.<br /><br />It really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential. Arne Glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times. Because of this, we as viewers, never really get involved with the story or any of it's characters.<br /><br />It really is too bad, for ""Just Cause"" had more than enough potential. A fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems. The cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller, that will probably still please the fan of the genre.

"This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none.I love how Stanley just dumps the women into the lake.I have been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years, and he blew me away. Its a blend of horror, and drama ,and romance, not so much comedy. His evil, yet charming look captured me right then and there. That look in his eyes, I will never forget. There's something about him, I cant describe.",1,this movie is the best horror movie  bar none i love how stanley just dumps the women into the lake i have been a fan of judd nelsons work for many years  and he blew me away  its a blend of horror  and drama  and romance  not so much comedy  his evil  yet charming look captured me right then and there  that look in his eyes  i will never forget  theres something about him  i cant describe 
"When this film was made, the hippie thing had gone mainstream. The ideas of the counter culture was well established, that is why such a big film could be made. Yet it has something to say, and it is said really beautifully. Apart from those who're only waiting for the wanking material, this film is given credit for its beautiful scenes(which in itself is more than enough reason to see the film) by the most. The soundtrack to this film, which actually became more popular than the film itself, is another plus. Pink Floyd's ""Careful with that axe Eugene"" suits really well with the explosions, the absence of music in other scenes gives the film a nice quiet mood. But. It seems as though the messages in this film have been overlooked by the most. If you didn't understand it, which seems to be the case for the most, I'll give you some hints: The man(tough guy, what ever his name is-Mark?) is a part of a ""reality group"". He leaves this group saying something like ""I'm willing to die. But not of boredom"" He later go for a joyride with a stolen plane, probably to seek some action. As he is in the air, Grateful Dead's Dark Star(from the Live/Dead album) is played(i think). This song contains the phrase ""Shall we go you and I while we can"", this is though not heard in the film.(Perhaps stretching it a bit too far meaning that quote is essential?) In the plane, he checks up a girl(Daria), who is driving in her car to a conference(about giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a super-relaxing place in the desert, where everything is so simple and nice. For the whole family!), by diving down, almost hitting the car. He lands the plane, and joins the girl on her way to Detroit. They stop at Zabriskie point, where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature. Later a family with a big car(of the type which you sleep in) and a speed boat is showed visiting Zabriskie Point, the father saying something like ""what a waste driving all the way up here"", and the kid sitting inside the car, grinning. I sensed a ""this wasn't much better than on the telly""-attitude. Daria takes Mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style, with the identity number changed to ""no war"" on one side and ""no words"" on the other. ""Bucks Sucks"" is also written on the plane. Mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from, saying to Daria before he leaves ""I don't risk anything"" or something, one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny. (This because he has the feeling that the environment that surrounds don't give him anything- ""I wonder what happens in the real world"") On the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane. Daria hears this on the radio, but decides to go to the conference in the fancy mansion. Here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend. She enjoys fresh water running down a rock, more than the swimming pool. Inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about anti-materialism -She looks out through a glass wall, holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped. The business men is seen arguing, the one side eager to make a big deal, the other afraid of losing money. Daria leaves the house and looks back at it, visualizing it blowing up. After the house, several other things blow up, for example a television. She smiles, happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with Mark look upon as something negative.<br /><br />To summarize: Mark obviously experience the ""reality group"" as not very useful as they just sit and talk, taking no action. He clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are, and it seems like he feels that it's no use fighting against it. He wants to leave. He helps Daria, who is ""in mind but not in action"" seeing his point of view. Where his feeling of being misfitted turns out leading to his death, one can hope Daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more constructive. In the film you see how a town (LA) is being polluted by commercial (too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point), you see business men deciding what is the future, et cetera, and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world.<br /><br />I have only seen the film once, so I have not caught all points, but I certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say, and I find it strange that this film can be called meaningless. If you say the points are being too obvious, I can see why, this film probably intended to appeal to the post-hippie radicals ""digging"" the thoughts of anti-establishment. Even though, it has a lot to say, and its message is still needed today, things pretty much evolving in the same direction as it did before the sixties. Zabriskie Point is a really great film, telling a story about quite normal young people (not far out hippies tripping around tip toe on acid, digging everything) seeking what they percept as real, dissatisfied with the conventional. And it is done in a truly beautiful way.",1,when this film was made  the hippie thing had gone mainstream  the ideas of the counter culture was well established  that is why such a big film could be

"I found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid-50's white mans body. He doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before. He listens to rap music, sings along, and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man. The real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community.",1,i found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian  chris rock  who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid 50s white mans body  he doesnt realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before  he listens to rap music  sings along  and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man  the real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community 
"Recap: Something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of Antarctica. The mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on Antarctica. Julian Rome, a former SETI-worker, is brought in to decipher the message. Problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. Soon the object is in the open. The mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. It is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, Julian decodes the signal. ""Do not open"". But too late, and the object explodes as it is finally breached, and two things unleashed on earth. The first is an alien, that had been dormant in the object, and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. And Washington, that is suspiciously updated on this historic event, decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. So a Russian nuclear submarine, carrying nuclear weapons is sent to Antarctica.<br /><br />Comments: The movie holds a few surprises. One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance, and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful, well worked through and a lot better than expected. Unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own, and this time not in a good way. Actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. It is never really explained why Washington know so much, why Washington is able to command Russian submarines, why the object is in the Antarctic and has woken up now. It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English. Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language (and obviously chose English, why?). But then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus, send their ""Do not open"" message encoded! And finally the end is as open as an end can be.<br /><br />The movie is a little entertaining but too much energy (from me) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot. Therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good.<br /><br />3/10",0,recap  something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica  the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica  julian rome  a former seti worker  is brought in to decipher the message  problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his  and the situation quickly turns awkward  especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him  and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly  soon the object is in the open  the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity  it is decided to open the object  but just before that is done  julian decodes the signal   do not open   but too late  and the object explodes as it is finally breached  and two things unleashed on earth  the first is an alien  that had been dormant in the object  and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff  and washington  that is suspiciously updated on this historic event  decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth  so a russian nuclear submarine  carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica  comments  the movie holds a few surprises  one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance  and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful  well worked through and a lot better than expected  unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own  and this time not in a good way  actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes  it is never really explained why washington know so much  why washington is able to command russian submarines  why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now  it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english  some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language  and obviously chose english  why    but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus  send their  do not open  message encoded  and finally the end is as open as an end can be  the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy  from me  must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot  therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good  3 10

"We often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics, but I still recommend ""City Hall"". In a role he was born to play, Al Pacino stars as New York's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy. But it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect. In this movie, the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust any given politician, you may have your doubts after watching this movie.<br /><br />I understand that I can't name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays, but that's not the point. If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this movie tears such ideas down. Certainly one that I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.",1,we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics  but i still recommend  city hall   in a role he was born to play  al pacino stars as new yorks mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy  but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect  in this movie  the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal  no matter how much you trust any given politician  you may have your doubts after watching this movie  i understand that i cant name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays  but thats not the point  if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top  this movie tears such ideas down  certainly one that i encourage you to see  also starring john cusack  bridget fonda  danny aiello  anthony franciosa and david paymer 
"I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick ""Snuff"". I was told that Devil's Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one, so my interest was peaked.<br /><br />Devil's Experiment is a short film with no story, no character development. Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways like beating her, spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours, smash her hand with a mallet, burning and putting maggots on the burns, throwing guts at her, and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye.<br /><br />I must say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the beating scenes. But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought ""Damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie"". I did enjoy the flick but I don't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10",1,i first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick  snuff   i was told that devils experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set  i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one  so my interest was peaked  devils experiment is a short film with no story  no character development  just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes  they torture her in various ways like beating her  spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol  forcing her to listen to hi pitched noise for 24 hours  smash her hand with a mallet  burning and putting maggots on the burns  throwing guts at her  and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye  i must say that a lot of this movie was fake  like the beating scenes  but then  some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out  the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it  or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about  the worst is the eye scene  i didnt shutter when watching it but simply thought  damn  that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie   i did enjoy the flick but i dont know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer  7 10

"Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor, and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in a class with the great Shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles; and he further suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, cleanly steals the show away. Olivier recognized that potential in his production, and cast Iago with someone he knew he could upstage. I didn't nearly realize the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see the views of Venice, too.",1,laurence fishburne is a fine actor  and deserves respect for trying this  but he is not in a class with the great shakespeareans like olivier and welles  and he further suffers from kenneth branagh  this irishman  always brilliant  cleanly steals the show away  olivier recognized that potential in his production  and cast iago with someone he knew he could upstage  i didnt nearly realize the possibilities of iago  shakespeares most evil character  but branagh shows us the depths  nice to see the views of venice  too 
"*** Contains Spoilers ***<br /><br />I did not like this movie at all.<br /><br />I found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made, irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: given that eventually we have to die, how should we approach life? In a ""light"" way, like Tomas; in a ""heavy"" way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like Sabina? How much is fidelity important in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I haven't read Kundera's novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will: I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning.<br /><br />I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. I simply don't see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows.<br /><br />1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.<br /><br />2) The ""secondary"" characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.<br /><br />3) I did not like how Tomas was impersonated. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human, in some sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible.<br /><br />4) It's very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?<br /><br />5) The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I am not even mother tongue. Moreover, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent.<br /><br />6) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it's not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good.<br /><br />7) I found the ending sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the ""metropoly"", distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. So what? Had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? I don't think so. I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.<br /><br />8) The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. You don't feel empathy, you don't relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.<br /><br />9) I hated the ""stop the music in the restaurant"" scene (which some comments praised a lot). Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I really don't see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. That's it. What's so special and unique about it?<br /><br />After all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave it a two).<br /><br />The ""Naked women Photoshoot"", where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented.<br /><br />The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. I found it quite original and Tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.<br /><br />Finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally ""designed"" in such a way that ""Tomas types"" are going to like it and ""Tereza ones"" are going to hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised drastically.",0,    contains spoilers     i did not like this movie at all  i found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made  irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes  given that eventually we have to die  how should we approach life  in a  light  way  like tomas  in a  heavy  way like tereza  or should we find ways not to face that question  like sabina  how much is fidelity important in a relationship  how much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones  how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our country  unfortunately  i havent read kunderas novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will  i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation  which is my guess  or if it was dull from the beginning  i disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece  i simply dont see the reasons why  what i see are many flaws  and a sample of them follows  1  the three main characters are thrown at you and its very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices  2  the  secondary  characters are there just to fill the gaps but they dont add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary  3  i did not like how tomas was impersonated  nothing is good for him  he is so self centered and selfish  he is not human  in some sense  but when his self confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone  i did not find the interpretation credible  4  its very unlikely that an artist like sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968  on top of that  the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions  which sounds strange to me  a  how can tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer  b  how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed  5  the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable  and i am not even mother tongue  moreover  the letter that sabina receives while in the us is written in czech  which i found very inconsistent  6  many comments praised the movie saying that prague was beautifully rendered  i guess that most of the movie was shot on location  so its not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling  and given the intrinsic beauty of prague is not even difficult to make it look good  7  i found the ending sort of trivial  tereza and tomas  finally happy in the countryside  far away from the temptations of the  metropoly   distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living  detached from their professional lives  die in a car accident  but they die after having realized that they are happy  indeed  so what  had they died unhappy  would the message of the movie have been different  i dont think so  i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience  8  the only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters  you see them for almost three hours  but in the end you are left with nothing  you dont feel empathy  you dont relate to them  you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say  9  i hated the  stop the music in the restaurant  scene  which some comments praised a lot   why sabina has got such a strong reaction  why franz agrees with her  i really dont see the point  the only thing you learn is that sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality  thats it  whats so special and unique about it  after all these negative comments  let me point tout that there are two scenes that i liked a lot  thats why i gave it a two   the  naked women photoshoot   where the envy  the jealousy  and the insecurities of sabina and tereza are beautifully presented  the other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of prague by the russians  tereza pictures  taken to let the world know about what is going on in prague  are used to identify the people taking part to the riots  i found it quite original and terezas sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed  finally  there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally  designed  in such a way that  tomas types  are going to like it and  tereza ones  are going to hate it  if this is the case  i strongly doubt it  though  then my comment should be revised drastically 
"Trite, clichéd dialog and plotting (the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies), hokey music, and a paint-by-numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans.<br /><br />What saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi's work, the rotoscoping, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta...in motion. The violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword & sorcery movie of the period.<br /><br />I like to watch this with the sound off, playing the soundtrack to the first Conan movie instead.",0,trite  clichéd dialog and plotting  the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies   hokey music  and a paint by numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans  what saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of bakshis work  the rotoscoping  and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him  this is frazetta   in motion  the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword   sorcery movie of the period  i like to watch this with the sound off  playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead 
"The movie is an extra-long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure's spirit.

"Rohinton Mistry's multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen but the resulting movie is filled with passion, emotion, humour and pathos. The story is somewhat slow-moving but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience. The movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with pinpoint accuracy. All of the actors are Indian - few if any known to ""western"" audiences - but they are a joy to behold, especially the little girl who acts very convincingly. Don't be put off by the title and plot summary - this is a movie to be seen on the big screen.

"This movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber.<br /><br />This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial English town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by Johns plan. However a glitch turns up - Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language. Although calm and emotionless on the outside, John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process.<br /><br />What happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor John from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message ""you would have probably acted likewise"".<br /><br />Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz make a great team acting Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, ""almost"" only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native Russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background.<br /><br />The pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out.<br /><br />My advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. To sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of the ""rude awakening"" from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a Society's machine, the life which members of the Fight Club were so keen to quit and the machine of which Pink Floyd sings (""Welcome to the machine!""). I bet that in the end, John was rather off with Sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all.<br /><br />Thank you, writers, for the great story, and everyone else for this great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers, I am sure of it.",1,this movie really woke me up  like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber  this guy john  ben chaplin  leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town  until the stunningly gorgeous  wild  girl to die for nadia  nicole kidman   ordered by email from russia  enters his life to become his beloved wife  by johns plan  however a glitch turns up   nadia does not speak a word of johns language  although calm and emotionless on the outside  john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service  he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process  what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making decently thinking action figure  giving the viewer a subliminal message  you would have probably acted likewise   kidman  cassel   kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing   almost  only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues  however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right  nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles  at least from the cultural background  the pace of the film is fast and captivating  and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear  you rather feel that youre in the middle of the plot  and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out  my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy  to sum it up  it has an unusual plot  great acting  and ideas below the surface  like the idea of the  rude awakening  from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a societys machine  the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings   welcome to the machine     i bet that in the end  john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all  thank you  writers  for the great story  and everyone else for this great movie  please make a sequel  and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever  because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99 9999 percent of the potential viewers  i am sure of it 
"No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. It's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.",0,no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series  of which only 3 have been on so far is awful  the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series  i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous  as a bbc licence payer  after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment  im amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didnt object to the story lines  these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons  surly they can see its lost all direction  its a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas  paul bentley  west yorkshire  england 
"I watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children.. The terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. And the sad thing is--internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains. All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has. I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed. I'm surprised this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio.

"This movie is amazing! While being funny and entertaining, it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening. I will watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, unsatisfied, and resentful that his life isn't the way he envisions it should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy.....with one exception. In the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him. As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was truly there. This movie was inspirational and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, ""Since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy?"" and my humble addition, ""May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out.""",1,this movie is amazing  while being funny and entertaining  it is also profoundly deep and eye opening  i will watch it again and again  bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life  he has a job and a life  but it isnt what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness  bruce is bitter  unsatisfied  and resentful that his life isnt the way he envisions it should be  as a result of this state of mind  bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life  god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers  bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted  his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy     with one exception  in the process of gaining everything  he loses the one person who truly loved him  as the movie unfolds  bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances  but his perception of what was truly there  this movie was inspirational and deep  if you really pay attention  it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize  as my wife says   since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy   and my humble addition   may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out  
"Really, I liked it. The premise was good, the story fit where both respective series left off, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valerie aren't bitter! They aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, ""The Partridge Family""). In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can re-run this one.",1,really  i liked it  the premise was good  the story fit where both respective series left off  and heres my favorite part  mary and valerie arent bitter  they arent like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it  or do possible reunions  a prime example is susan dey   the partridge family    in fact  valerie was saying that shed be thrilled to do another movie  and then mary said the same thing later  so i would be on the look for another   but if that doesnt quite work out  then they can re run this one 
"All right I recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquers the martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch was going to do next.

"Effort aside (This isn't a review about good intentions, its about the final product), this film is poorly written, overacted, and poorly directed. The story obviously had potential, but that story is nowhere present in this film.<br /><br />Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and self doubt just like the rest of us. You would never know that from this film of the lead actress's performance. In fact apply that to every character in the film, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. An epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot. In fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting, and I realized thats because she's making a speech! Every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot. For example, when she sees a wounded man, she'll start pontificating about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white flags, etc. As played in the film, there's no WAY she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds.<br /><br />IN conclusion, this film robs Clara Barton of her struggles. It robs her of her humanity, and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clichés. The writer doesn't know Clara Barton, and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia Britannica article. (yes they had those back then) But hey, nice Technicolor!

Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like police series, but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong. <br /><br />First of all, the writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it EVERY TIME!!!!!

"'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It is a very dark film, and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred. The film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours (contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. However, despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across.

"I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of ""A New Hope"" and the thrilling sophistication of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" I remember awaiting ""Return of the Jedi"" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).<br /><br />From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this ""film"" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.<br /><br />Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from ""A New Hope"" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: ""I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.""<br /><br />There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.",0,i very nearly walked out  but id paid my money  and my nearly as disgusted friend wanted to hold out  after the endearing  wide eyed innocence of  a new hope  and the thrilling sophistication of  the empire strikes back   i remember awaiting  return of the jedi  with almost aching anticipation  but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage  i was bitterly disappointed  and enraged at lucas  he should have been ashamed of himself  but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesnt have subatomic particle of shame in his cold  greedy heart  episode i would go on to reinforce this fact    your honor  i call jarjar binks  but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first   from the initial raising of the gate at jabbas lair  this  film  was nothing more than a two plus hour commercial for as many licensable  profit making action figures as lucas could cram into it    the pig like guards  the hokey flesh pigtailed flunky  that vile muppet pet of jabbas  the new and recycled cabaret figures  the monsters  etc   etc   ad vomitum  then there were the detestably cute and marketable ewoks  pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens  fifteen seconds each on screen  or less  and the kiddies just gotta have one for their collection  the blatant  exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating  lucas didnt even bother to come up with a new plot    he just exhumed the death star from  a new hope  and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment  what an appalling slap in the face to his fans  i cant shake the notion that lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans   ive got these lemmings hooked so bad that i can crank out the worst piece of stinking  putrid garbage that i could dream up  and theyll flock to the theaters to scarf it up  plus  all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped  cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in  and i get a cut from every single one  itll make me even more obscenely rich   there may have been a paltry  partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip off  i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool  but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that lucas so avariciously embraced in this total  absolute sell out to profit

He also starts to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office.<br /><br />It's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family. There are many touching scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy.

"THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) **1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /><br />Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a stand-out low-key performance.<br /><br />What is it about celebrities and fans? What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /><br />In the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, Williams stars as a talk-radio personality named Gabriel No one, who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to No one's editor Ashe (Morton) who gives it to No one to read for himself. <br /><br />No one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of Pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette giving an excellent performance) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete is dying from AIDS. Naturally No one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has No one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into Donna and Pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate.<br /><br />Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film's novice director Stettner) and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does. It helps that Williams gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.<br /><br />However the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.",1,the night listener  2006    1 2 robin williams  toni collette  bobby cannavale  rory culkin  joe morton  sandra oh  john cullum  lisa emery  becky ann baker   dir  patrick stettner   hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand out low key performance  what is it about celebrities and fans  what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm   in the latest derange fan scenario  based on true events no less  williams stars as a talk radio personality named gabriel no one  who reads stories hes penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand  culkin  who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no ones editor ashe  morton  who gives it to no one to read for himself   no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna  collette giving an excellent performance  who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids  naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess  cannavale  whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and petes backgrounds discovering some truths that he didnt anticipate  written by armistead maupin  who co wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the films novice director stettner  and based on a true story about a fans hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot boiler does  it helps that williams gives a stand out  low key performance as the conflicted good hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him  the one thing that has escaped his own reality  and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core  however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner  it pays to listen to your own inner voice  be careful of what you hope for 
"- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was ""The Twilight Zone"". The flashbacks are pretty much useless. One part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better. I wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting, even from the adults was horrid. A kissing scene in this movie even sucked. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I highly do not recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /><br />- Good Stuff: I don't know what I can say really. There is some suspense parts that get you going, but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting. <br /><br />- My Verdict: Do not watch.",0,  bad stuff  this movie is real crap  bad stunts for one thing  they looked so fake i thought this was  the twilight zone   the flashbacks are pretty much useless  one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better  i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting  even from the adults was horrid  a kissing scene in this movie even sucked  this movie killed the book  the book was great  i highly do not recommend this movie  not even for educational purposes     good stuff  i dont know what i can say really  there is some suspense parts that get you going  but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting     my verdict  do not watch 
"Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985. It is awful. Almost everything fails. First off, Attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to mangle ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the CASTING!!! They are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you couldn't take your eyes off of them. But this cast just gets by dancing, does a ""nice"" job singing but none of them spark one bit. In fact, look up the cast on IMDb - none of them really went on to do anything much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the stage musical. A total strike-out! (But even though they try to smother the music - the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was).",0,yes  i was lucky enough to see the long running original production of michael bennetts hit musical  it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985  it is awful  almost everything fails  first off  attenborough  a fine actor  a good director with the right material  is a sorry choice   almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie  the camera is always in the wrong place   they chop up the songs and the casting    they are awful   the power of the play was these dancers   these hungry  talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance   you couldnt take your eyes off of them  but this cast just gets by dancing  does a  nice  job singing but none of them spark one bit  in fact  look up the cast on imdb   none of them really went on to do anything much   ok  ok  janet jones married gretzky   sheesh   so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic  the desperation  the passion of the stage musical  a total strike out   but even though they try to smother the music   the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was  
"Don't get me wrong, this is a terrible, clichéd film, but it is a delight for fans of Olivia Hussey - quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen. One poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at - I wonder what his ideal woman looks like - Paris Hil-slut? Blockbuster should really establish a sub-genre to this type of film, as the Fatal Attraction plot has become a genre unto itself. When will Blockbuster adopt the ""Adultry"" section? It will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered his ex-wife, who looks remarkably like Ms. Hussey. This ne'er-do-well proceeds to stalk Olivia and thus make her life a living-hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their spouses, so I really wasn't rooting for Olivia to make it out o this stinker alive.<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$ (There is a smattering of violence in the film. Don Murray and Anthony John Denison get involved in a fisticuffs when Denison says that he will not stop seeing Olivia, Murray's wife, because she is just too good in bed. Olivia also gets to handle a shooter and might get to squeeze off a round - I'll let you watch).<br /><br />NUDITY: $$ (Olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here. She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene - shot at a distance).<br /><br />STORY: $ (We've seen this plot before - a hundred times over, and oftentimes done much better. The true culprit, when trying to decipher why this film was a dud, is William Riead. The man's dialogue is sophomoric and moronic. The man has no story-telling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot. These people, of the upper strata of society, talk like middle school kids - with a habit of sleeping during English class. I have placed Riead on the Never-to-be-Viewed-Again list).<br /><br />ACTING: $$$ (The acting wasn't ""phoned-in"" as the insiders say, but was hindered a great deal by Riead's juvenile script. Olivia Hussey resorts to calling Anthony Jonh Denison ""weird"" and ""crazy"" to his face when he begins to stalk her. Hussey, who is still beautiful, delivers the best performance here but Denison was equal to the task of portraying a demented, love-crazed stalker. Don Murray was basically just there - his character not fleshed out, and Edward Asner, a terrific actor when given something with substance, is ill-used in this film).",0,dont get me wrong  this is a terrible  clichéd film  but it is a delight for fans of olivia hussey   quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen  one poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at   i wonder what his ideal woman looks like   paris hil slut  blockbuster should really establish a sub genre to this type of film  as the fatal attraction plot has become a genre unto itself  when will blockbuster adopt the  adultry  section  it will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections  right  this film revolves around olivia hussey  who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered his ex wife  who looks remarkably like ms  hussey  this neer do well proceeds to stalk olivia and thus make her life a living hell  i like olivia hussey  but i have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their spouses  so i really wasnt rooting for olivia to make it out o this stinker alive  violence      there is a smattering of violence in the film  don murray and anthony john denison get involved in a fisticuffs when denison says that he will not stop seeing olivia  murrays wife  because she is just too good in bed  olivia also gets to handle a shooter and might get to squeeze off a round   ill let you watch   nudity      olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here  she has a love scene with anthony john denison and also has a shower scene   shot at a distance   story     weve seen this plot before   a hundred times over  and oftentimes done much better  the true culprit  when trying to decipher why this film was a dud  is william riead  the mans dialogue is sophomoric and moronic  the man has no story telling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot  these people  of the upper strata of society  talk like middle school kids   with a habit of sleeping during english class  i have placed riead on the never to be viewed again list   acting       the acting wasnt  phoned in  as the insiders say  but was hindered a great deal by rieads juvenile script  olivia hussey resorts to calling anthony jonh denison  weird  and  crazy  to his face when he begins to stalk her  hussey  who is still beautiful  delivers the best performance here but denison was equal to the task of portraying a demented  love crazed stalker  don murray was basically just there   his character not fleshed out  and edward asner  a terrific actor when given something with substance  is ill used in this film  
"Ghost Story,(The New House) is a terrific horror story. This is from the Circle Of Fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies.The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early family series, Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the lead actors, and as the main characters in the story.I saw this recently,and I was so scared!If you are alone,I would not recommend that you watch this.This story is terrific,no gore or curse words, but very scary.

"Very bad. Very, very bad. As a fellow who aspires to make, be in or - at least - sniff the catering table at a movie set, I find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made. However, this movie ... oh dear.<br /><br />Realizing Frightworld doesn't aspire to anything more than crude exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake. And to be fair, it is more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not by much. So I won't try to critique, just let me ask throw out some observations.<br /><br />1) If gore is the point of the movie, shouldn't you be able to see it?<br /><br />2) If you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment.<br /><br />3) In a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll. Difficult I know but really...<br /><br />4) There is a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo/Rochester area, most you can hire really cheap. Get one who knows how to frame a scene.<br /><br />5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs doesn't mean he should do so every two seconds.<br /><br />6) Kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time, get girls who's tops we want to see taken off.<br /><br />7) Editing should help tell the story or set a mood. At the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags. A chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary, it's sloppy.<br /><br />Some good things. Not all the acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once she started fighting back. There was some neat imagery, unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason. ""Acid Poptart"" is a name that deserves a better movie. I like the moxie of Frightworld too.

"In this day and age of incredible special movie effects, this one was a sore disappointment. The actors seemed stiff and uninspired, as was the dialogue. Westerns are not common fare for Hollywood so much these days, but movies like ""Silverado"" prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one. Considering that, it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing, much less creating such a weak film as this one. If you love and are looking for a good western, keep looking!",0,in this day and age of incredible special movie effects  this one was a sore disappointment  the actors seemed stiff and uninspired  as was the dialogue  westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days  but movies like  silverado  prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one  considering that  it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing  much less creating such a weak film as this one  if you love and are looking for a good western  keep looking 
"This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People getting hit in the head is not funny. People getting kicked is not funny. After the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore. It just got tired fast.<br /><br />I went with my younger sister. She actually laughs out loud at King of the Hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty lame. A midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in Hollywood history. Then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story. Say those two lines over and over for 1.5 hours and you'll get the picture There were predictable jokes galore. I really felt ripped off after seeing this. I wasn't expecting much and I was still disappointed. I wish Keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and/or his next script. This was even worse than White Chicks if that is possible. I've seen high school plays that were better, and cheaper.<br /><br />There wasn't anything positive about this movie.

"Despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad ""documentary,"" I must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative. That said, after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it, one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands. <br /><br />One suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping.<br /><br />The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no cautionary clues or explanations, only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight. <br /><br />This soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version (hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable) all the more remarkable. Act II is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely, setting the sad inmates' plight to music, raises the human tragedy to art. Even more important, this act is preceded by a fine Act I where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness, and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about. In short, everything which the FILM is lacking.<br /><br />To the filmmakers' credit (or their successors), the excellent Criterion DVD release includes out-takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film - behind the scenes photographs, interviews and commentary - filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression. They can't make the amateurish film itself satisfying, but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible. <br /><br />Ultimately though, it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie which raises the rating of the original GREY GARDENS above a single (generous) star.",0,despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad  documentary   i must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative  that said  after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it  one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands   one suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us   or those we know   are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping  the film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and  unlike the musical  offers no cautionary clues or explanations  only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight   this soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version  hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable  all the more remarkable  act ii is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely  setting the sad inmates plight to music  raises the human tragedy to art  even more important  this act is preceded by a fine act i where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness  and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about  in short  everything which the film is lacking  to the filmmakers credit  or their successors   the excellent criterion dvd release includes out takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film   behind the scenes photographs  interviews and commentary   filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression  they cant make the amateurish film itself satisfying  but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible   ultimately though  it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer doug wright  composer scott frankel and lyricist michael korie which raises the rating of the original grey gardens above a single  generous  star 
"Water Lilies is a well-made first film from France about young female sexuality and friendship. Sciamma works with specialized, slightly sanitized material that is as off-putting to some as it is alluring to others. The film focuses exclusively on three middle-class teenage girls in a tidy new Paris suburb. Their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team.<br /><br />Such distractions as parents, siblings, work and school have been neatly excised from the equation. The central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny Marie (Pauline Acquart), who is not on the team, but thinks she would like to be. Marie worships Floriane (Adèle Haenel), an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after. This takes Marie away from her former best friend, also a member of the water ballet team, the somewhat plump Anne (Louise Blachère). Being less special Anne is more truly accessible to the boys. Floriane, like this film, promises a bit more then she truly offers. Marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl: she suffers inwardly. Flroiane doesn't so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt.<br /><br />Marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as Floriane. Floriane takes advantage of this to make Marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations, then, lacking any other friends, her confidante. All the other girls think Floriane a slut, an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases, because it leads them on. She suffers the pretty girl's fate of being not a person but an object, and she can't resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her, but she doesn't really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap. Enlisting Marie to act as her pal so her (unseen) mother won't know she's going out to meet boys, she also gets Marie to rescue her from the boys later. It looked the opposite at first, but Floriane needs Marie as much as Marie thinks she needs her. Anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that's earthier and more real than the other girls'.<br /><br />Keeping all external context at bay, Sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls' goals and interactions. On the other hand the film's water madness, which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots, makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly. Luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever-present goals and avoidances and just do silly, pointless girl things. It's the offbeat moments that give the film life; too bad in a way that there aren't more of them. But Sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics. Along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls, who understandably love to gaze at themselves. <br /><br />There's no great revelation or drama on the way, but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that Marie doesn't just admire but truly desires Floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends--whom Floriane always stops before they go all the way. In a typical irony of this kind of plot, Floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with Marie--but Marie is the one who holds off, because she knows it won't have the significance to Floriane that it will have to her. When it happens, it's a timid, mechanical affair. Meanwhile Anne has a huge crush on Francois (Warren Jacquin), a male swimmer, but of course he is after Floriane. Boys are not an element that's been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor, but they are just bodies and faces, available studs.",1,water lilies is a well made first film from france about young female sexuality and friendship  sciamma works with specialized  slightly sanitized material that is as off putting to some as it is alluring to others  the film focuses exclusively on three middle class teenage girls in a tidy new paris suburb  their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team  such distractions as parents  siblings  work and school have been neatly excised from the equation  the central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny marie  pauline acquart   who is not on the team  but thinks she would like to be  marie worships floriane  adèle haenel   an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after  this takes marie away from her former best friend  also a member of the water ballet team  the somewhat plump anne  louise blachère   being less special anne is more truly accessible to the boys  floriane  like this film  promises a bit more then she truly offers  marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl  she suffers inwardly  flroiane doesnt so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt  marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as floriane  floriane takes advantage of this to make marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations  then  lacking any other friends  her confidante  all the other girls think floriane a slut  an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases  because it leads them on  she suffers the pretty girls fate of being not a person but an object  and she cant resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her  but she doesnt really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap  enlisting marie to act as her pal so her  unseen  mother wont know shes going out to meet boys  she also gets marie to rescue her from the boys later  it looked the opposite at first  but floriane needs marie as much as marie thinks she needs her  anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid thats earthier and more real than the other girls  keeping all external context at bay  sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls goals and interactions  on the other hand the films water madness  which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots  makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly  luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever present goals and avoidances and just do silly  pointless girl things  its the offbeat moments that give the film life  too bad in a way that there arent more of them  but sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics  along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls  who understandably love to gaze at themselves   theres no great revelation or drama on the way  but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that marie doesnt just admire but truly desires floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends  whom floriane always stops before they go all the way  in a typical irony of this kind of plot  floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with marie  but marie is the one who holds off  because she knows it wont have the significance to floriane that it will have to her  when it happens  its a timid  mechanical affair  meanwhile anne has a huge crush on francois  warren jacquin   a male swimmer  but of course he is after floriane  boys are not an element thats been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor  but they are just bodies and faces  available studs 
"This movie had mediocrity, laziness, and thoughtlessness written all over it. If you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already, then you better do a damn good job. I'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it. Some scary/horror movies just fail to break the mold of the ""lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies"" cliché. This one, sadly, was no different, and like all scary movies, once you venture down that road there is no going back.<br /><br />And the ending? How do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie, but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end? The ending was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 which I will never watch. Terrible movie.",0,this movie had mediocrity  laziness  and thoughtlessness written all over it  if you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already  then you better do a damn good job  ill be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it  some scary horror movies just fail to break the mold of the  lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies  cliché  this one  sadly  was no different  and like all scary movies  once you venture down that road there is no going back  and the ending  how do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie  but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end  the ending was very anti climatic and spelled part 3 which i will never watch  terrible movie 
"Yes, this gets the full ten stars. It's plain as day that this fill is genius. The universe sent Trent Harris a young, wonderfully strange man one day and Harris caught him on tape, in all that true misfit glory that you just can't fake. Too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow's story. The other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the young men, respectively. The world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling, giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla America.

"I went for this movie believing it had good ratings. Firstly, it is ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the film had bright sparks during that scene, I missed it as I was sleeping on my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles a Devil. She wears ill-fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids. As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money!

"Joan Fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself. Her husband (Richard Ney) has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance, and they are reduced to living in a tiny room, with little or no prospects. They continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong. He is a charming, feckless, but wholly amiable fellow. However, Fontaine decides he has to go, as he has outlived his usefulness. So she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her, so that she can move on. She has meanwhile had a lover (Patric Knowles) whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either. She meets the aging Herbert Marshall, who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even Fontaine could figure out how to spend. She targets him and decides he will do nicely. He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty. He certainly isn't very exciting, and has about as much sex appeal as yesterday's omelette. But Fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money, and the man standing between her and it is transparent, so that she doesn't even notice or care what he looks like, she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it. She proceeds to poison her husband, and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily, so that everything is going well. But as always happens in the movies, and sometimes even in life, some unexpected things begin to go wrong, and the tension rises appreciably, so that Fontaine begins to sweat. Fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified, and as the net begins to close in on her, her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats. Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning. But she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover, who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up. He is condemned to death for murder, because the husband's death by poison came to light unexpectedly. But Sir Cedric Hardwicke, playing a grimly determined Scotland yard inspector, thinks there may be something amiss, and begins to doubt the story and suspect Fontaine. He closes in on her, and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic. But will the innocent man's life be saved before he is executed? Will Fontaine worm her way out of this one? Will Herbert Marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation? This film is expertly directed by Sam Wood, and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which I suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir.",1,joan fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself  her husband  richard ney  has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance  and they are reduced to living in a tiny room  with little or no prospects  they continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong  he is a charming  feckless  but wholly amiable fellow  however  fontaine decides he has to go  as he has outlived his usefulness  so she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her  so that she can move on  she has meanwhile had a lover  patric knowles  whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either  she meets the aging herbert marshall  who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even fontaine could figure out how to spend  she targets him and decides he will do nicely  he is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty  he certainly isnt very exciting  and has about as much sex appeal as yesterdays omelette  but fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money  and the man standing between her and it is transparent  so that she doesnt even notice or care what he looks like  she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it  she proceeds to poison her husband  and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily  so that everything is going well  but as always happens in the movies  and sometimes even in life  some unexpected things begin to go wrong  and the tension rises appreciably  so that fontaine begins to sweat  fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified  and as the net begins to close in on her  her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats  hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning  but she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover  who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up  he is condemned to death for murder  because the husbands death by poison came to light unexpectedly  but sir cedric hardwicke  playing a grimly determined scotland yard inspector  thinks there may be something amiss  and begins to doubt the story and suspect fontaine  he closes in on her  and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic  but will the innocent mans life be saved before he is executed  will fontaine worm her way out of this one  will herbert marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation  this film is expertly directed by sam wood  and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which i suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir 
"I like my Ronald Colman dashing and debonair, the fellow you see in such films as If I Were King and Kismet. I like him as the epitome of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. A brooding Colman isn't a favorite of mine.<br /><br />But in A Double Life precisely because his part as actor Anthony John is so offbeat for him, Colman was recognized with a Best Actor Oscar for 1947. It became his best known part.<br /><br />Colman is an actor who really does take the Method quite seriously. He's just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and he's quite the jovial fellow. For a change of pace now that that play has concluded its Broadway run, Colman is bringing a revival of Othello to New York. About as opposite a part as you can get.<br /><br />His leading lady in both is his former wife Signe Hasso who loves him dearly, but can't take his change of moods when he's at work. Colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back. But he's heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with her role as Desdemona.<br /><br />Unfortunately Shelley Winters as a poor waitress who a depressed Colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor Desdemona in the play. Killed in the same manner and now it's a matter for homicide cop Joe Sawyer.<br /><br />Colman's performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an occupational hazard with actors? I'd shudder to think so, were there any unsolved homicides in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles then they essayed Othello. <br /><br />I could never quite buy the story for that reason, but I certainly do applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the part. I'm sure there was a tinge of regret in him winning the Oscar though because one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father. Others in the running that year were Gregory Peck for Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul, and Michael Redgrave for Mourning Becomes Electra.<br /><br />Colman gets able support from the rest of the cast including Edmond O'Brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of Cassio in Colman's jealous fantasy. Still you will find no Iago equivalent in A Double Life, no one prodding the jealousy, it's all in his own mind.<br /><br />And that from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century.",1,i like my ronald colman dashing and debonair  the fellow you see in such films as if i were king and kismet  i like him as the epitome of civilization as in the lost horrizon and random harvest  a brooding colman isnt a favorite of mine  but in a double life precisely because his part as actor anthony john is so offbeat for him  colman was recognized with a best actor oscar for 1947  it became his best known part  colman is an actor who really does take the method quite seriously  hes just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and hes quite the jovial fellow  for a change of pace now that that play has concluded its broadway run  colman is bringing a revival of othello to new york  about as opposite a part as you can get  his leading lady in both is his former wife signe hasso who loves him dearly  but cant take his change of moods when hes at work  colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back  but hes heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous moor othello and hasso with her role as desdemona  unfortunately shelley winters as a poor waitress who a depressed colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor desdemona in the play  killed in the same manner and now its a matter for homicide cop joe sawyer  colmans performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an occupational hazard with actors  id shudder to think so  were there any unsolved homicides in or around laurence olivier and orson welles then they essayed othello   i could never quite buy the story for that reason  but i certainly do applaud ronald colman and what he did with the part  im sure there was a tinge of regret in him winning the oscar though because one of the other nominees was his good friend william powell for life with father  others in the running that year were gregory peck for gentlemens agreement  john garfield for body and soul  and michael redgrave for mourning becomes electra  colman gets able support from the rest of the cast including edmond obrien who finds himself in the unwanted part of cassio in colmans jealous fantasy  still you will find no iago equivalent in a double life  no one prodding the jealousy  its all in his own mind  and that from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century

"I had read a few positive reviews of this film, and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was. Positioned as some cross between an AIDS-related story and some kind of ""Ghost""/""Blithe Spirit"" tale, this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be. <br /><br />Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an ""open"" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV+ and he and Simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore. When Mark dies, Simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was much different. But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts, while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film. By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic, it's too late to care. Mark, on the other hand, follows in Demi Moore's footsteps from ""Ghost,"" by crying profusely throughout the movie. <br /><br />There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor, a la the TV show ""Bewitched."" But that doesn't last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish, with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings. The finale, with a gold-plated muscle-boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened, grief-stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying, chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny.",0,i had read a few positive reviews of this film  and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was  positioned as some cross between an aids related story and some kind of  ghost   blithe spirit  tale  this film cant always make its mind up what it wants to be   simon and mark are a gay couple who have an  open  relationship   simon is able to have anonymous  though safe  sex on the side when he wants  mark is hiv  and he and simon dont seem to have a sex life anymore  when mark dies  simon   who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father   tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor  not that his behavior before marks death was much different  but mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts  while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelings  unfortunately  simon is such a selfish sob  its impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film  by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic  its too late to care  mark  on the other hand  follows in demi moores footsteps from  ghost   by crying profusely throughout the movie   there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns  suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor  a la the tv show  bewitched   but that doesnt last long  once simons emotional health is at stake  the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish  with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings  the finale  with a gold plated muscle boy angel guiding a tearful mark to heaven while a chastened  grief stricken simon waves goodbye is just stupefying  chiefly because it isnt intentionally funny

"This is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen. I was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes/races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are ""going fast"" In one scene a Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds by just spinning around in circles. Its just ridiculous.<br /><br />If you wanna see a real movie about cars, see the fast and the furious series. They may be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this movie could ever hope to be.

"When I saw Birthday Girl I liked it so much I set out to see every Nicole Kidman film I could, only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it. I theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control, with Nicole Kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment--IMHO. Thus for instance, Dogville, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home, or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else's attention, or other pet causes of Kidman's. <br /><br />Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job. I don't how or who was able to restrain her, but apparently it worked. The way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And consequently, what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable. <br /><br />Of course, the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy, but his transformation is adequately believable. It isn't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego. Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances.<br /><br />Also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, apart from their criminal mission. Her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to American culture. And while they are his adversaries, they are never really his enemy. In effect, they teach him to be compete.<br /><br />I really marveled at Kidman's ability to physically appear Russian.

"This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process.<br /><br />I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2.

"Some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West period. Get a grip and read a book. There were quite a few Asians (Chinese), there were quite a few blacks (freedmen) and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns; it is the second amendment you know. And as far as the use of modern language goes, none of those Westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted. Americans had different accents, used different inflections, spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today.

"After all these years I still consider this series the finest example of World War II documentary film making. The interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project. It would be great to see a contemporary documentarian(Ken Burns ?) take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone. With modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when The World At War was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. The History Channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of WWII but an expansive series such as the World At War has not been successfully attempted since the original.

What was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways, but managed to attend every major 60's event through the country.

"Why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary ""Earth""? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain this to you? OK, I will not elongate my review exploration on ""Earth"" to infinity, but I must stand my ground on why this is a ""must see"". The documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families: a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path, a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey, and an elephant mama with her small (maybe not so small, they are elephants) offspring migrating in Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield did an ""out of this earth"" job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists. The cinematographically skilled team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch, and Andrew Shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors; not to mention, the slo-mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e. ""Earth"" is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals; the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence.

"This film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they didn't quite come together. I don't know who made it, but it has a slightly Disney-esque feel. While parts of it are improbable (like when a pre-teen runs for a public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normalcy (whatever that is) to keep things balanced and in perspective. The acting is alright. Strangely, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit...off. It's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend, her grandmother, and her two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player myself, it was quite painful to watch Frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys, but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces. I read somewhere that she isn't really ballerina, but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but its star Mischa Barton didn't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in ""Lawn Dogs"", ""Lost and Delirious"", and her small but shocking performance opposite Haley Joel Osment in ""The 6th Sense.""",1,this film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients  but somewhere along the way they didnt quite come together  i dont know who made it  but it has a slightly disney esque feel  while parts of it are improbable  like when a pre teen runs for a public office  and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously  there is a healthy dose of normalcy  whatever that is  to keep things balanced and in perspective  the acting is alright  strangely  the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing  but the relationship between hazel and frankie is a bit   off  its interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend  her grandmother  and her two passions  ballet and baseball  being a baseball player myself  it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys  but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces  i read somewhere that she isnt really ballerina  but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful  overall  it was a good film about honesty and ambition  but its star mischa barton didnt quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in  lawn dogs    lost and delirious   and her small but shocking performance opposite haley joel osment in  the 6th sense  
"and rent a GOOD horror movie. It's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie"".<br /><br />In between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialog ever written. Stupid ""we're going to the prom"" junk. I wanted to claw my ears off. Honestly, ""The Hills"" has better dialog.<br /><br />There really was no need to make this movie. Leading lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking ""Her? Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really?"" <br /><br />All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and back! Not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.) <br /><br />The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). Nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). The people are like mentally disabled sheep.<br /><br />By the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. All the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done. (So boo hoo for you!) <br /><br />None of the killings is the least bit interesting. Most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.<br /><br />The only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies. ""Oh kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer -- AIIEEEE!"" <br /><br />And then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore.<br /><br />The audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout. It was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough. Don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making.<br /><br />(Oh, and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen. No tiara. No bucket of blood.) <br /><br />So save your money and rent ""Carrie"" or ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" or ""Scream"" or ""Scary Movie"" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.",0,and rent a good horror movie  its like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didnt realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like  scream  and  scary movie   in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written  stupid  were going to the prom  junk  i wanted to claw my ears off  honestly   the hills  has better dialog  there really was no need to make this movie  leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking  her  really  guy is obsessed with her  really    all the characters act in stupid ways  including the police   cover the place in teams of 2  front and back  not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed    the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem  no resistance from victims  or doors   nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back  or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door   the people are like mentally disabled sheep  by the by  if youre a gore fan  youll be disappointed too  all the killing is kept offscreen and is    ahem    tastefully done   so boo hoo for you    none of the killings is the least bit interesting  most of the time theyve already happened by the time we find out  the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies   oh kitty  you scared me  i thought you were the killer    aiieeee    and then at the end when its time for the killer to die    well  lets just say its the easiest and most obvious choice  snore  the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout  it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough  dont encourage this kind of lazy film making   oh  and by the way    no crowning of a prom king or queen  no tiara  no bucket of blood    so save your money and rent  carrie  or  friday the 13th  or  halloween  or  scream  or  scary movie   any of them  to get a good scare with some original twists

"Colman's performance is aided by the brilliantly written script. The gargantuan Hollywood studios in the 30's and 40's were able to copy some of the German expressionistic film elements and incorporate them into Hollywood films. very good use of shadows and light and silhouette. i really liked the scene where colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film, and he starts reciting Othello while his face becomes instantly dark and evil. already the viewer sees the text and the drama of Shakespeare getting a hold of ""Tony"" and off he goes on his journey of doom. i also enjoyed the dramatic death scene within the play, when he becomes overwrought with emotion and accidentally strangles his costar a little too hard for her to bear. her pleadings ""tony stop you're hurting me"" are chilling and suspenseful. you just don't know if he is going to go over the top and kill her at any moment. the cat and mouse chase to reveal the killer was nicely added 2/3rds of the way through the film to add some faster pacing and to also add to the narrative element of the film.

"It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. It's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had.

"High energy Raoul Walsh classic from 1933, The Bowery places saloon owner and operator Wallace Beery against bitter rival and dandy, George Raft, with adopted street kid Jackie Cooper and good looking Faye Wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry. It's not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids. Plenty of wisecracks at the beginning, but the characters soften up as the film progresses. Apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in Beery's saloon. The various characters, sexy chorus line, lots of drinking, a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so-called pre-code restrictions, and then later come the Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation herself. It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that's long gone. I don't like to compare eras, but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today. The film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see.",1,high energy raoul walsh classic from 1933  the bowery places saloon owner and operator wallace beery against bitter rival and dandy  george raft  with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry  its not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about  but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids  plenty of wisecracks at the beginning  but the characters soften up as the film progresses  apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in beerys saloon  the various characters  sexy chorus line  lots of drinking  a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so called pre code restrictions  and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself  it all creates a very vivid picture of a life thats long gone  i dont like to compare eras  but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today  the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see 
"When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, I thought it was too harsh but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.<br /><br />Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.<br /><br />The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK. I mean, it was not 100% believable but it was OK...nothing great. I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Wait for it on cable or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.",0,when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies  i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct  i am a big fan of the wayans brothers  i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks  little man  however  had very few laughs and the jokes were stale  obviously  the joke will revolve around marlon wayans  who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison  he and his partner  tracy morgan  steal a diamond meant for a gangster  things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington  in order to get the diamond back  the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep  of course  he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond  the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour  all these talents  however  cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny  the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok  i mean  it was not 100  believable but it was ok   nothing great  i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses  wait for it on cable or television  it really is not worth any amount of money

"This was one of the worst movies EVER!!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was laughing through the WHOLE movie! The plot was SO cheesy; especially the end. This movie turns from an end-of-the-world-disaster to save-the-eels! I mean, c'mon! And I swear...I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eels! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced. How predictable! It was SO terrible that my mom, my sister, and I couldn't finish it, and when we DID finish it, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and we finished it this time, we did MST3K-like comments throughout the movie.<br /><br />Summary: Only watch this if you're a movie basher! Make hilarious comments, watch this at a sleepover for laughs, and I mean HUGE laughs. Also watch for mockery. The metaphor that explains this movie: This movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets!",0,this was one of the worst movies ever         it was so bad  i was laughing through the whole movie  the plot was so cheesy  especially the end  this movie turns from an end of the world disaster to save the eels  i mean  cmon  and i swear   i think they use sock puppets for the eels  and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced  how predictable  it was so terrible that my mom  my sister  and i couldnt finish it  and when we did finish it  it was about a year later  the second time we watched it and we finished it this time  we did mst3k like comments throughout the movie  summary  only watch this if youre a movie basher  make hilarious comments  watch this at a sleepover for laughs  and i mean huge laughs  also watch for mockery  the metaphor that explains this movie  this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets 
"An entertaining kung fu film, with acting, plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky. All of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comedy antics are fun to watch, and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills. For me, the film's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast -- at times, things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots, and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed-out as one might wish.<br /><br />But a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple definitely delivers on that count. The film climaxes with a high-bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent.<br /><br />Overall, Shaolin Temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu movie. Not up to the quality of a good Jet Li film, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10.<br /><br />Misc notes: The 1987 Warner Home Video release I saw was (predictably) poorly dubbed, and lacked full cast & crew credits.",1,an entertaining kung fu film  with acting  plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky  all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists  alexander fu shengs proto jackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch  and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills  for me  the films only glaring flaw is the size of the cast    at times  things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots  and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed out as one might wish  but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action  and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count  the film climaxes with a high bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent  overall  shaolin temple is an enjoyable low budget kung fu movie  not up to the quality of a good jet li film  but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre  my rating  8 10  misc notes  the 1987 warner home video release i saw was  predictably  poorly dubbed  and lacked full cast   crew credits

"This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone ever made. This is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself. ""First Blood Pt. 2"" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's ""Commando"", but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, this was the peak of the Cold War, but I'm sick of having Communists or the Nazis always being shown as the enemy. There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common. Why can't there a movie that show Americans as the enemy? Who's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think that something like this would have really happened? By the looks of it, an average, brain washed American viewer certainly would.",0,this movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies stallone ever made  this is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself   first blood pt  2  is very similar to schwarzeneggers  commando   but there you have arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys  this movie is a typical american anti soviet propaganda  true  this was the peak of the cold war  but im sick of having communists or the nazis always being shown as the enemy  there are so many american movies that have this one thing in common  why cant there a movie that show americans as the enemy  whos going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army  do you really think that something like this would have really happened  by the looks of it  an average  brain washed american viewer certainly would 
"I was really impressed with this film. The writing was fantastic, and the characters were all rich, and simple. It's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them. The creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters, and getting the viewer sucked right into their world. Further, the music is terrific. They employed some independents to do the score, and some of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie. If you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival (like I did), I highly recommend that you go see it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's reason enough to go check it out.",1,i was really impressed with this film  the writing was fantastic  and the characters were all rich  and simple  its very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them  the creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters  and getting the viewer sucked right into their world  further  the music is terrific  they employed some independents to do the score  and some of the soundtrack  and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie  if you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival  like i did   i highly recommend that you go see it  also  on a personal note  paget brewster is beautiful in this movie  thats reason enough to go check it out 
"I have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes, I still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow, yet thoughtful actions of the story-telling. I am still a fan.....with some minor pains.<br /><br />Though this installment into the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything(sound familiar?), I have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plans(especially the character called Wufei...I mean he whines more than an American character on a soap opera. Get a counselor,will ya?)<br /><br />Besides for the over-exaggerated drama(I think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the English voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again. I mean it can always be worse.

"This is a very good, under-rated action/drama/and slightly historical movie.<br /><br />The basic story concerns Rob Roy's borrowing of 1000 pounds, its theft, and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen.<br /><br />Cunningham( Tim Roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. Brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil.<br /><br />Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is excellent too, but i think the writers used the word ""honour"" 1 too many times.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed.<br /><br />The Action is exciting and the sword play very realistic, but not too gory.

"this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that I've ever seen on screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction. he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it's primitive in a good sense. his purity, honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art. I was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly. the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that Goldsworthy's art has. it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself. Fred Frith's score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound. this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect. it has no boundaries as far as age goes.",1,this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that ive ever seen on screen  andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction  he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that its primitive in a good sense  his purity  honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art  i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end  sometimes prematurely  but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly  the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthys art has  it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself  fred friths score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound  this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect  it has no boundaries as far as age goes 
"Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors which I am always interested in seeing, despite reviews. I have always found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching.<br /><br />I say ""nearly"" and ""almost"" in large part because of this movie.<br /><br />First off, Meg Ryan does not play a likeable character, she plays a weak-willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less likeable.

"From the moment the film begins, already there is a discrepancy. As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the middle East, and is also an international film, one would expect proper accents portrayed. This is not done as the majority of the cast sound American. Also, I find the acting to be rehearsed at best, the story line a little difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery. If you want to see a movie to get a feel of what it was like in the past (albeit the lack of accents) then this movie is worth a rent.

"I just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent sci-fi film noire. It's style is definitively unique and very well made. It is filmed with actual actors, but transformed into a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before. It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does it well. It's a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures. The story and mood remind of Blade Runner, and if you liked that one you will surely like this one, too. The storyline is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists.

"I admit the problem I have with the much-celebrated Ealing films I've seen so far could be mine. To my taste, either they are black and rippingly funny, or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories. That's a self-important way of saying I wanted to like ""The Man In The White Suit"" but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time.<br /><br />Textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be meek in manner, but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that can't be broken or made dirty. Using a factory lab for his latest experiment, he toils against limitations both material and human - the latter being the benighted mill bosses who don't understand what he is up to, then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him.<br /><br />""It's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress,"" Sidney complains, practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the Man.<br /><br />One problem with ""Man In The White Suit"" is that Sidney's vision of progress is awfully small-minded, too, more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work. My problem is more elemental: For a comedy, ""White Suit"" is not funny. It's a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit-takes, double-takes, triple-takes, and dizzy takes.<br /><br />The best joke is the sound of the machine Sidney toils at, going ""Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop"" endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until Sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying. Like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film, it's leaned on too long.<br /><br />I've never seen Guinness less affecting in a movie, even though he looks impossibly young and earnest (though actually in his mid-30s). He seems so bloodless, even more so than the wax-faced general he played in ""Doctor Zhivago"" He's the same cold fish whether he's ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job (pan-faced Vida Hope as Bertha) or the more sultry charms of young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), his one real ally in his fight against ""shabbiness and dirt"", as she puts it, making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only Greenwood could.<br /><br />Supporting players make ""White Suit"" work as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger of ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like Nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in ""Lawrence Of Arabia"". Then there's the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else.<br /><br />But most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldn't think director Alexander Mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before (his previous Ealing comedy ""Whisky Galore"" doesn't reverse that impression, alas). Roger MacDougall's play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster, but fails to present dull Sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights.<br /><br />Ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy. Yet the Ealings I've seen never seem to do this, working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies. ""Kind Hearts And Coronets"" and ""The Ladykillers"" (Mackendrick again, go figure) are classics this way. ""White Suit"", on the other hand, is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere, just like that unfortunate suit.",0,i admit the problem i have with the much celebrated ealing films ive seen so far could be mine  to my taste  either they are black and rippingly funny  or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories  thats a self important way of saying i wanted to like  the man in the white suit  but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time  textile worker sidney stratton  alec guinness  may be meek in manner  but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that cant be broken or made dirty  using a factory lab for his latest experiment  he toils against limitations both material and human   the latter being the benighted mill bosses who dont understand what he is up to  then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him   its small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress   sidney complains  practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the man  one problem with  man in the white suit  is that sidneys vision of progress is awfully small minded  too  more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work  my problem is more elemental  for a comedy   white suit  is not funny  its a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit takes  double takes  triple takes  and dizzy takes  the best joke is the sound of the machine sidney toils at  going  bleep blop bleep bop  endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying  like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film  its leaned on too long  ive never seen guinness less affecting in a movie  even though he looks impossibly young and earnest  though actually in his mid 30s   he seems so bloodless  even more so than the wax faced general he played in  doctor zhivago  hes the same cold fish whether hes ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job  pan faced vida hope as bertha  or the more sultry charms of young daphne birnley  joan greenwood   his one real ally in his fight against  shabbiness and dirt   as she puts it  making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only greenwood could  supporting players make  white suit  work as well as it does  ernest thesinger of  bride of frankenstein  fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle  howard marion crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in  lawrence of arabia   then theres the undeniable charm of mandy miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else  but most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldnt think director alexander mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before  his previous ealing comedy  whisky galore  doesnt reverse that impression  alas   roger macdougalls play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster  but fails to present dull sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights  ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy  yet the ealings ive seen never seem to do this  working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies   kind hearts and coronets  and  the ladykillers   mackendrick again  go figure  are classics this way   white suit   on the other hand  is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere  just like that unfortunate suit 
"I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be pretty cool. ""Guaranteed to offend...everyone!"" the trailer said.

I'm not gay and I don't have a problem with those who are, but what's the point of adding so many gay-scenes in a so called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? I guess the director is a gay man in denial, or something like that.<br /><br />So my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times, you'll be better off than watching this Mother Of All Lousy Comedy's.

"(contains slight spoilers)<br /><br />It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart is, of course, remembered by many as George Bailey from Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. In ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born. In ""The Far Country"", Stewart's Jeff Webster, by not getting involved to help anyone else (except himself), gets to see essentially the same thing: A world in which he (for all practical matters) doesn't exist.<br /><br />By not getting involved (and by attempting not to care about anyone), Webster is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt, pushed around, and even killed while he stands by and does nothing. This reminds the viewer of George Bailey watching a world that has turned upside-down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born. <br /><br />Both movies end with the same image - a close-up of a ringing bell.

"A documentary about two rocks bands, spanning a number of years. Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure.<br /><br />Anton Newcombe, the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre, is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues, his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols, but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan). Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all BJM's music, can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day, has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius, but is also a heavy drugs user, flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life, and can blow deals as fast as he makes them. BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable.<br /><br />The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market  as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of 'cool.' DiG! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy. At one point, Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act')  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe. By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like 'Every Day Should Be A Holiday' and 'Bohemian Like You', Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated. BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time, let off with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass.<br /><br />The wider appeal of DiG! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music. The downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius, and there are feint glimpses of this in the film, but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this. In the words of one of the band members: ""In every spiritual tradition, you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up."" Newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime, and DiG! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius.",1,a documentary about two rocks bands  spanning a number of years  brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols  what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure  anton newcombe  the main man of brian jonestown massacre  is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues  his friends and rivals the dandy warhols  but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him  sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world  newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience  getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan   newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments  writes and produces all bjms music  can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day  has a prophet like obsessiveness with his own musical genius  but is also a heavy drugs user  flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity  orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life  and can blow deals as fast as he makes them  bjm go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise newcombes talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable  the warhols acknowledge their debt to newcombes creativity and dont even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the warhols have something that bjm dont  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense  the real world  and their market  as a mixing pot of talent  even if much of it is distilled from guru newcombe  and accessibility  they are the very definition of cool  dig  follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy  at one point  newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the warhols  in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap to clean up their act   only he forgets to tell them its a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against newcombe  by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like every day should be a holiday and bohemian like you  newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated  bjm are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the warhols get busted for drugs around the same time  let off with a warning  and even allowed to keep the grass  the wider appeal of dig  is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music  the downside is that it is still a documentary  however intimate  and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands  newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius  and there are feint glimpses of this in the film  but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this  in the words of one of the band members   in every spiritual tradition  you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up   newcombe isnt pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime  and dig  has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius 
"I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I no longer believe the story. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is sappy, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" as ""nu-cu-ler,"" just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the ""nu-cu-ler"" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I didn't find it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good for killing a rainy afternoon.

George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick. I was most imprest by William H.

"This is the magnum opus from the Swedish king of crap, Mats-Helge Olsson. Seldom has a movie of this magnitude been made in Sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in Swedish film to date. Who pays for these things? <br /><br />The Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to defect to Sweden. But his plans are ruined by the Russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in Sweden. This trickery is their way of seeing to that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the whole planet. The CIA however is bent on getting Markov to the west and send their ninja to liberate him.<br /><br />The practice of having Swedish actors speaking English is something that Mats-Helge has perfected in his later works. The cheap b-movie feeling this creates is probably unmatched for performance. But besides this? Well the action is standard direct-to-video style. Machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians dying. People running around in black ninja suits, trying to hide in the snow.<br /><br />What really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed. When they say ""Ninja"" in the title i expect martial arts, i expect close combat. But there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie. And they are hilarious. It's so bad i lack the words to describe it. If the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop. And of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special-effects budget consisting of four food-stamps and a McDonald's voucher.<br /><br />So what's the verdict? Instant classic of course. Never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol. It's the ultimate party movie. Insert into video and laugh. One just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more. This is film history.<br /><br />Therefore the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.",1,this is the magnum opus from the swedish king of crap  mats helge olsson  seldom has a movie of this magnitude been made in sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in swedish film to date  who pays for these things   the russian nuclear scientist markov wants to defect to sweden  but his plans are ruined by the russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in sweden  this trickery is their way of seeing to that markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the whole planet  the cia however is bent on getting markov to the west and send their ninja to liberate him  the practice of having swedish actors speaking english is something that mats helge has perfected in his later works  the cheap b movie feeling this creates is probably unmatched for performance  but besides this  well the action is standard direct to video style  machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke  thousands of russians dying  people running around in black ninja suits  trying to hide in the snow  what really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed  when they say  ninja  in the title i expect martial arts  i expect close combat  but there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie  and they are hilarious  its so bad i lack the words to describe it  if the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop  and of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special effects budget consisting of four food stamps and a mcdonalds voucher  so whats the verdict  instant classic of course  never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol  its the ultimate party movie  insert into video and laugh  one just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more  this is film history  therefore the rating is 8 10 for entertainment  1 10 for quality and 10 10 for accents 
"Let me be up-front, I like pulp. However it is like one of these ""easier dives"" that you see at the Olympics. It has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of, say, a late medieval painter.<br /><br />This is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often (or more accurately, most of the time!) ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains. If not always in the right way. Check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle.<br /><br />(However quite why it has been given a ""Worst Film"" Razzie is baffling - I bet there was a thousand worse films made in 2006, but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim.) <br /><br />Head case and popular novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now over in London writing a novel, but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather. God heavens, she can't even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and I am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand Hollywood style.<br /><br />Yes, clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around (if you like your pulse to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean why would anyone put two-and-two together and start thinking she might be a murderer? Equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual. However is this just a personality disorder (some form of b/s risk addiction) or further evidence of her guilt? <br /><br />For reasons I cannot fully understand or explain Stone is assigned to psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another ""lover found dead in mysterious circumstances"". Thankfully (for Stone) he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home/working life of his own. In the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blur.<br /><br />In to this heady mix comes Roy Washburn (a strange Welsh sounding David Thewlis) who tells the love struck doctor - in his capacity of policeman of many years standing - that the lady in question may be dangerous. I mean, hold the front page. However Glass is now too glassy-eyed to realise or care. Like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime-time Mike Tyson he ripe for the big take-down, however not before finding that Washburn might have a secret or two himself.<br /><br />Now comes Millena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this film) of someone who isn't barking mad or else a murder suspect. Presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of Stone's - thankfully (for us at least) those days are long gone. Strangely she doesn't think Stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else - or else she doesn't think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper acting.<br /><br />After several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliff-hanger/twist, that while as farcical as the rest of the movie, gives us enough elbowroom for Basic Instinct 3 - highly unlikely this may be at this point in time.",1,let me be up front  i like pulp  however it is like one of these  easier dives  that you see at the olympics  it has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of  say  a late medieval painter  this is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often  or more accurately  most of the time   ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains  if not always in the right way  check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle   however quite why it has been given a  worst film  razzie is baffling   i bet there was a thousand worse films made in 2006  but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim    head case and popular novelist catherine tramell  sharon stone  is now over in london writing a novel  but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather  god heavens  she cant even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and i am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand hollywood style  yes  clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around  if you like your pulse to be above zero   but is she personally responsible  i mean why would anyone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a murderer  equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual  however is this just a personality disorder  some form of b s risk addiction  or further evidence of her guilt   for reasons i cannot fully understand or explain stone is assigned to psychiatrist michael glass  david morrissey  for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another  lover found dead in mysterious circumstances   thankfully  for stone  he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home working life of his own  in the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blur  in to this heady mix comes roy washburn  a strange welsh sounding david thewlis  who tells the love struck doctor   in his capacity of policeman of many years standing   that the lady in question may be dangerous  i mean  hold the front page  however glass is now too glassy eyed to realise or care  like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime time mike tyson he ripe for the big take down  however not before finding that washburn might have a secret or two himself  now comes millena gardosh  charlotte rampling  a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example  in this film  of someone who isnt barking mad or else a murder suspect  presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of stones   thankfully  for us at least  those days are long gone  strangely she doesnt think stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else   or else she doesnt think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper acting  after several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliff hanger twist  that while as farcical as the rest of the movie  gives us enough elbowroom for basic instinct 3   highly unlikely this may be at this point in time 
"What more can be said? I have not been this fascinated with a young actress since Cate Blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago. And although both Blanchett and Blunt have played Queens now( seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses), the roles are complete polar opposites.<br /><br />Simply put if you are looking for high passion, compelling drama, and Machiavellian intrigue, this is not the movie for you. This isn't to say that the script or direction was bad, its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like Elizabeth I, Anne Boylen, Henry VIII, Henry V, Henry II and Elainor of Acquitane. These are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of British ,and in most cases, world history. Victoria, in contrast, ascended the throne without incident, she quasi-governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the Navy, her State had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians, and she married young had a harmonious family life. The facts of her life are not the Sturm und Drag such as powerful dramas are made of.<br /><br />The heart of the film, aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne, is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign- a love story. Marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion, yet Victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a Patron Saint marital fidelity, happiness and ideal family life. Thus, central to the film is the budding love of Victoria and her Prince Albert. I was very taken with Rupert Friend's characterization of Albert whom he portrayed as a kind, patient, somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man, looking to"" do good in the world and help"". In short, he is a good man with a good heart, not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around, but as that is not the point of the story, that does not matter. The heart of the character shines through thanks to Friend's understated yet earnest performance. <br /><br />As for the Queen, well..Emily Blunt is sublime. Her beauty cannot be denied, but she is more than something pretty to look at; her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness. The slightest arch of the eyebrow, glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much. Again, this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas, its not that kind of movie. But what Ms. Blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety. <br /><br />For example, we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by Victoria's mother ( Miranda Richardson) and her scheming adviser/lover Conroy expressed in the simple things like Victoria trying to sketch her dog. We see her delight and fascination upon first meeting Albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him. We see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing Parliament upon her Ascension. And my favorite scene of all in the film- we see her nervous, happy, and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life- ask the man she loves to marry her, a proposition so ridiculous for those times( and some would say now) that Victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say ""marry me"". Again, this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions, but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much.<br /><br />So, overall, I judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such I give it a 7. I felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development, namely Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, and the characters of Conroy and Lord Peal. Again, the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters, but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment. Also I would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between Victoria and Albert, but that may be just my greed for more scenes between Friend and Blunt. <br /><br />In summary, don't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is, a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures. I give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances, brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent Victoria of Emily Blunt. And anyone who has any shred of romance left in them, you will be touched by the end of this movie. God save the Queen.",1,what more can be said  i have not been this fascinated with a young actress since cate blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago  and although both blanchett and blunt have played queens now  seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses   the roles are complete polar opposites  simply put if you are looking for high passion  compelling drama  and machiavellian intrigue  this is not the movie for you  this isnt to say that the script or direction was bad  its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like elizabeth i  anne boylen  henry viii  henry v  henry ii and elainor of acquitane  these are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of british  and in most cases  world history  victoria  in contrast  ascended the throne without incident  she quasi governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the navy  her state had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians  and she married young had a harmonious family life  the facts of her life are not the sturm und drag such as powerful dramas are made of  the heart of the film  aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne  is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign  a love story  marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion  yet victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a patron saint marital fidelity  happiness and ideal family life  thus  central to the film is the budding love of victoria and her prince albert  i was very taken with rupert friends characterization of albert whom he portrayed as a kind  patient  somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man  looking to  do good in the world and help   in short  he is a good man with a good heart  not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around  but as that is not the point of the story  that does not matter  the heart of the character shines through thanks to friends understated yet earnest performance   as for the queen  well  emily blunt is sublime  her beauty cannot be denied  but she is more than something pretty to look at  her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness  the slightest arch of the eyebrow  glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much  again  this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas  its not that kind of movie  but what ms  blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety   for example  we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by victorias mother   miranda richardson  and her scheming adviser lover conroy expressed in the simple things like victoria trying to sketch her dog  we see her delight and fascination upon first meeting albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him  we see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing parliament upon her ascension  and my favorite scene of all in the film  we see her nervous  happy  and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life  ask the man she loves to marry her  a proposition so ridiculous for those times  and some would say now  that victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say  marry me   again  this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions  but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much  so  overall  i judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such i give it a 7  i felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development  namely miranda richardson as the duchess of kent  and the characters of conroy and lord peal  again  the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters  but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment  also i would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between victoria and albert  but that may be just my greed for more scenes between friend and blunt   in summary  dont view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is  a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures  i give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances  brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent victoria of emily blunt  and anyone who has any shred of romance left in them  you will be touched by the end of this movie  god save the queen 
"I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had packed away all their toys. (Toddlers don't like to watch ""Regis and KAthie Lee"" or ""The View."") My four year old found one scene funny, but told me the rest of it was ""too silly."" This is a FOUR YEAR OLD, folks. Anyone over the age of, say, nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out.<br /><br />To say this movie is bad is like saying the Holocaust was a little mistake. There are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this ""film"" truly is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse. Bronson ""Balki"" Pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could tell), but all the characters are awful. I haven't watched a real Laurel and Hardy film in ages, but I KNOW that they HAD to be way better than this. What is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with... this?<br /><br />Bottom line: derivative garbage.

"You'd think the first landing on the Moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it. However, this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light. It talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other. It makes the computer overload problem (the 1202 and 1201 alarms) encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near-catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all. And it takes the ""thirty seconds"" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out, when it's actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory.<br /><br />If you want to see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go for ""From the Earth to the Moon"" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.",0,youd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it  however  this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light  it talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions armstrongs nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle  as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other  it makes the computer overload problem  the 1202 and 1201 alarms  encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all  and it takes the  thirty seconds  call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out  when its actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory  if you want to see a documentary or dramatization of apollo 11  go for  from the earth to the moon  or one of the pbs documentaries  but skip this one 
"Screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture--he reveres them--yet Audrey Hepburn is (naturally) put a notch above the others because, after all, she's the princess Bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior. He shoots her in loving close-ups, gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled Ben Gazzara, and allows her room to sparkle throughout. The love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing, though I did tire of John Ritter's TV-styled klutziness. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten, and the grounded, earthy-sensual Patti Hansen are all exciting to watch. But it's really Hepburn's valentine and she absolutely glows. *** from ****",1,screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city  peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture  he reveres them  yet audrey hepburn is  naturally  put a notch above the others because  after all  shes the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior  he shoots her in loving close ups  gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard boiled soft boiled ben gazzara  and allows her room to sparkle throughout  the love connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing  though i did tire of john ritters tv styled klutziness  colleen camp  dorothy stratten  and the grounded  earthy sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch  but its really hepburns valentine and she absolutely glows      from     
"Watching beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy. So The House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.<br /><br />There are many allusions to different Hitchcock pictures, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the starring role. She is dressed up as Grace Kelly, and she is not far off the mark. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way she is introduced to the audience, she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. After all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific issue. But the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run-off-the-mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable, as the performances of the actors are good, as are the photography and the set design.<br /><br />The finale in Central Station, New York is breath taking. It starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof. The movie can be praised for its good use of architecture.",0,watching beautiful women sneaking around  playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy  so the house on carroll street was not entirely a waste of time  although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating  there are many allusions to different hitchcock pictures  not least the choice of kelly mcgillis in the starring role  she is dressed up as grace kelly  and she is not far off the mark  not at all  but her character is not convincing  the way she is introduced to the audience  she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life  after all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period  true events and a specific issue  but the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run off the mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences  high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters  this is all the more regrettable  as the performances of the actors are good  as are the photography and the set design  the finale in central station  new york is breath taking  it starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof  the movie can be praised for its good use of architecture

"When Samantha Eggar (as Phyllis Dietrickson) answers the door of her house swathed in a towel, you realize that as competent an actress as Eggar may be, she doesn't have the hypnotic allure of Barbara Stanwyck. And it is not entirely Eggar's fault. In the original film, Wilder had Stanwyck not only appear in a towel, but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house. And she doesn't ""come out""; she appears, almost as if by magic. Walter Neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor. There is a reason for this. Stanwyck is much higher than Neff (Fred MacMurray) when they are first introduced. It is not just the towel. The towel adds to the seductive allure. Her pose is like a Greek Goddess overlooking her domain, and, in a strange way, you feel as if, from the start, she is actually controlling the entire situation. She has sexual, even magic, power. This person is no ordinary housewife. This person is a mystery with secrets hidden within.<br /><br />Back to 1973. The remake has Crenna knock on the front door. Stanwyck's stand-in, Eggar, answers the door with a towel around her. There is no ""appearance"". She simply opens the door. The alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of Stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973. She opens the door with a towel around her. It may be sexy in a Charlie's Angels sort of way, but it's not nearly as mysterious. The filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand Wilder's point. The script may have said ""Phyllis appears in towel"" so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel. The point is not the towel. The point is the enigmatic quality of Phyllis, and the potential power she wields. Wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique. The filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that's what Wilder did. And in the choice of shot, lost all of Phyllis' mystique.<br /><br />Richard Crenna also seems miscast. He seems like he's ""acting"" and not really in the midst of the dilemma. Part of the problem is Crenna appears so much like a 70's actor. He can't get into the 1940's. When MacMurray first speaks into the microphone, sweat begins to drip from his face. No sweat on Crenna. And they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning. In the original, Neff says, ""I didn't get the money, and I didn't get the woman."" In the 1973 version, Crenna says, ""I didn't get the money, and I didn't want the woman."" Did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story? Or were they dumbing it down for a ""television"" audience?<br /><br />This made-for-TV movie is a by-the-numbers rendition. All the sharp edge of the original is lost. The only stand-out, maybe, is Lee J. Cobb in the role made famous by Edward G. Robinson. But he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original. This 1973 boring remake is a forgettable TV-movie made probably by the same people who did ""Gilligan's Island"". They might as well have tried to remake ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Gone with the Wind"". If mediocrity is the best one can hope for, what's the point? The 1944 classic is a Film with a capital ""F"".

"Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie back in 2001.

"This is one of those films that explore the culture clash of Eastern born people in Westernized cultures. <br /><br />Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences. Ken, rock n'roll fanatic, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so that she can stay in the United States when her visa expires. The marriage is only expected to be temporary, that is, until Kyoto gains legal status again. But, Ken, who seems to be lost in every relationship, takes a liking to Kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out. This, despite his friend's urging that dumping Kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n' roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that.<br /><br />But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese upbringing, and doesn't expect to be married to Ken all that long. Not only that, she is homesick and wants to return to Japan. It's sad in that this is finally someone Ken thinks he can love and be with and all that, except the one time he thinks he's found someone to feel that way about, the girl isn't expecting to stay that long. It's not that she doesn't like Ken, it's just that she's used to a whole 'nother way of life. She says, ""I can't tell him the way I feel in English, and Ken can't tell me the way he feels in Japanese."" It's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno-nintendo soundtrack.<br /><br />I picked up Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films, Tokyo Pop.

"This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant.<br /><br />The cinematography is inventive, crossing at times the border to gimmickry, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring TV soap in costumes, given that the entire story is dialogue-driven.<br /><br />The acting is competent. Ms Paltrow is aloof, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match-making endeavours. Some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures. Personally, I had problems accepting Alan Cumming as Mr Elton - to no fault of his own, except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley-dolly in ""The High Life"" that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part. Acting honours go to Toni Collette who manages to radiate warmth, and Jeremy Northam who pitches his character at just the right level.",1,this is a good adaptation of austens novel  good  but not brilliant  the cinematography is inventive  crossing at times the border to gimmickry  but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes  given that the entire story is dialogue driven  the acting is competent  ms paltrow is aloof  as her character requires  but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions  in other words  she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match making endeavours  some of the supporting cast is guilty of over acting   very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures  personally  i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton   to no fault of his own  except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley dolly in  the high life  that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part  acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth  and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level 
"A movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the Luzhin Defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character.<br /><br />	It gives John Turturro what is probably his finest role to date (thank goodness they didn't give it to Ralph Fiennes, who would have murdered it.) Similarly, Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage). To reach the tortured chess master (Turturro) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love. Watson does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.<br /><br />	In a chance meeting between Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that, we realize later in the film, has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations. Later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (Luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with ""bold, brilliant moves"" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover).<br /><br />	This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and, in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (Or so we are led to believe - certainly, within the time frame, Natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother).<br /><br />	The Italian sets are stunning.

"This is a really fun, breezy, light hearted romantic comedy. You cannot go wrong with Meg Ryan's cute perkiness combined with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally, I'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people, now deceased and not able to defend themselves, but I think the late Einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one.<br /><br />It's the 1950's...Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a pretty, young, scatter brained mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk, a behavioral researcher named James, merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children. However, it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). As she doesn't think Ed is intelligent enough, her uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, plays match maker, assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed appear suitably smart, so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist...naturally with amusing results.<br /><br />Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self, and pulls off the character of Einstein quite effectively. With his three professorial buddies, Kurt, Nathan, and Boris, a lot of laughs ensue. The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one (outrageous) step further. If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story happening!<br /><br />It might not be rocket science (despite its main character) but it is a wonderful sweet, refreshing movie. One of the best of the comedy romance genre.",1,this is a really fun  breezy  light hearted romantic comedy  you cannot go wrong with meg ryans cute perkiness combined with albert einsteins genius  normally  im not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people  now deceased and not able to defend themselves  but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one  its the 1950s   princeton  new jersey in the spring  the story revolves around a pretty  young  scatter brained mathematician  catherine  meg ryan   who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk  a behavioral researcher named james  merely because he has the brains shes looking for in the father of her future children  however  its love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed  tim robbins   as she doesnt think ed is intelligent enough  her uncle  none other than albert einstein  plays match maker  assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies  all theoretical physicists  uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart  so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist   naturally with amusing results  walter matthau is his usual hilarious self  and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively  with his three professorial buddies  kurt  nathan  and boris  a lot of laughs ensue  the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one  outrageous  step further  if you suspend all logic  you can almost imagine this silly story happening  it might not be rocket science  despite its main character  but it is a wonderful sweet  refreshing movie  one of the best of the comedy romance genre 
"Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. This is then compounded with, ............................yes I'll say it, BAD ACTING! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching ""Coffee Talk"" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no prize either, but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another Austin Powers movie.

"Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) stands trial for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses give evidence - Father Warecki (Henry Travers), Wilhelm's brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Wilhelm's former lover Marja (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense. The film ends after the court sums up....<br /><br />The film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand. The story is mostly set in a small Polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills), who Wilhelm is accused of raping; the treatment of the Jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps; and the church service where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) denounces his Nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris), Marja's daughter, after she has been shot at a brothel.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest.

"Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling, dark, and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders, claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but ""demons"", and that they have been selected by God to destroy these ""demons"". This is all told in flashback by one of the sons, now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) to skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe).<br /><br />Hard to automatically forget this film; better than most serial killer features, it's a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks. Paxton, commendably, barely shows any blood at all until near the end. Well acted by all, especially the two child actors (Jeremy Sumpter of the recent ""Peter Pan"" and Matt O'Leary of ""Spy Kids 2"" and ""Domestic Disturbance""). The only reason I deducted any points at all is because I can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach. In any event, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script.<br /><br />8/10",1,actor paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling  dark  and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic  paxton himself  who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders  claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but  demons   and that they have been selected by god to destroy these  demons   this is all told in flashback by one of the sons  now grown up  matthew mcconaughey  to skeptical fbi agent  powers boothe   hard to automatically forget this film  better than most serial killer features  its a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks  paxton  commendably  barely shows any blood at all until near the end  well acted by all  especially the two child actors  jeremy sumpter of the recent  peter pan  and matt oleary of  spy kids 2  and  domestic disturbance    the only reason i deducted any points at all is because i can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach  in any event  its an atypical thriller with a decent script  8 10
"I just don't understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here. Jeez. It is mindless, it isn't polished and it is (as I am reading) wasted on some. The cast of this movie plays their characters to the 'T' (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Ben Stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination. The problem is they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel. I just don't get it.

"I have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago, and to this day I have always told people it is probably the best film I have ever seen.

I would highly recomend this film, I wish it was available on DVD.",1,i have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago  and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen  considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound  i would highly recomend this film  i wish it was available on dvd 
"This movie lost me with the crossbow RPG (rocket-propelled grenade). It was like someone cut and pasted a scene from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say exclaim, ""I LIKE IT!""<br /><br />I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from ""The Dead Zone"" TV show and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie -- unlike any of his costars. They kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence.<br /><br />There are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material. However, even on its own, this movie's plot is not good. It's just boring, which even the low budget doesn't excuse. Having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story, dialog and decent acting. Those things don't cost much. Instead, they spent their money on half-assed CGI and some decent costumes and sets.<br /><br />Life is too short to watch this movie.",0,this movie lost me with the crossbow rpg  rocket propelled grenade   it was like someone cut and pasted a scene from robocop  i half expected beowulf to say exclaim   i like it   i watched this because i like chris bruno from  the dead zone  tv show and he did his part  he chose a strange accent  but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie    unlike any of his costars  they kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old english to modern english  sometimes in the same sentence  there are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material  however  even on its own  this movies plot is not good  its just boring  which even the low budget doesnt excuse  having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story  dialog and decent acting  those things dont cost much  instead  they spent their money on half assed cgi and some decent costumes and sets  life is too short to watch this movie

"A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress (a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) to complete the horror film that her mother (a dreadfully dull Kylie Minogue!) tried to make 12 years ago. It's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. The film has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. But she's back, because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the ""set."" Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern ""slasher,"" but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it rips half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Lots of film-world name-dropping a la ""Scream"" (except it's Aussie name-dropping--Jane Campion...see how this isn't as funny) and lots of ""is this real or is this a movie"" a la ""New Nightmare."" The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost everything is bad about this. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: ""Don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own,"" to which he responds, ""that doesn't mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!"" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret renting this one. ""You got any diet coke in here?"" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and ""Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?"" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and ""Where the hell is my agent?""

"**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**<br /><br />The titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father (an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next) from a moth-eaten, dime-store mummy and nasty Nazis out to--what else?--build a Fourth Reich.

"I'm a big mark for the music of Neil Young, and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many alt-indie press circles, hit the first showing of Greendale I could find. My excitement was short-lived, as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointed.<br /><br />Neil says the film started as a soundtrack, and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to craft a story. No character really has an arc, and when ""significant"" events do happen, the viewer doesn't cared, because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point. The film is all song, and to that end, the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they're sung...the technique works for the first stanza it is done, and is grating on the nerves after that. It doesn't feel real or fake, it just feels unwelcome.<br /><br />Terrible acting, with characters finding one mood and playing all of it. Poor lighting at times. The only kudos I can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast, but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it. An alright soundtrack, but nothing I'm quick to buy.

"Superficically, ""Brigadoon"" is a very promising entertainment package. Gene Kelly and Vincente Minnelli, the team behind ""An American in Paris"", are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations. Gene's leading lady is Cyd Charisse, one of the best dancers of 40s/50s cinema, and unlike the generally superior ""It's Always Fair Weather"" this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances. Lerner and Loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as ""My Fair Lady"" and Minnelli's musical masterpiece ""Gigi""; Lerner and Minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent ""American in Paris.""<br /><br />What happened along the way? Why is the movie itself such a stupid bore? Minnelli himself didn't want to do the movie, despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with Lerner. Maybe it was because the movie's innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for MGM and one step backward for Vincente Minnelli. But once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of Brigadoon are trapped within its city limits, Minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting, if not liberating way. The ultimate result is truly horrific to behold.<br /><br />While aiming for the naive charm of previous Minnelli hits like ""Cabin in the Sky"" and ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", the plaid-tights wearing inhabitants of Brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never-have-been locales. Its whimsy doesn't even match up to the glossy luster of ""Yolanda and the Thief"" or ""The Pirate"" because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions. The only people in Brigadoon who I at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow-traveler played by Van Johnson who accidentally shoots him. The general proceedings in the township of Brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of Christianity: they seem positively pagan in their aspect. For example, in exchange for Brigadoon's immortality, the honorable and most generally ""good"" pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge.<br /><br />At one point we're assured that ""everybody's looking for their own Brigadoon."" Suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren't looking for this kind of quasi-queasy paradise. The premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing, but could work if the players were perfect. But Kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie, and Charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as Lucille Bremer was miscast in ""Yolanda and the Thief."" Van Johnson does his best version of the classic Oscar Levant sidekick to Kelly (even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like Levant in ""AIP""), and he provides a lot of amusing moments. But it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of MGM is a tossed-off Van Johnson performance.",0,superficically   brigadoon  is a very promising entertainment package  gene kelly and vincente minnelli  the team behind  an american in paris   are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations  genes leading lady is cyd charisse  one of the best dancers of 40s 50s cinema  and unlike the generally superior  its always fair weather  this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances  lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as  my fair lady  and minnellis musical masterpiece  gigi   lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent  american in paris   what happened along the way  why is the movie itself such a stupid bore  minnelli himself didnt want to do the movie  despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner  maybe it was because the movies innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli  but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits  minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting  if not liberating way  the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold  while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like  cabin in the sky  and  meet me in st  louis   the plaid tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never have been locales  its whimsy doesnt even match up to the glossy luster of  yolanda and the thief  or  the pirate  because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions  the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him  the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity  they seem positively pagan in their aspect  for example  in exchange for brigadoons immortality  the honorable and most generally  good  pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge  at one point were assured that  everybodys looking for their own brigadoon   suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us arent looking for this kind of quasi queasy paradise  the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing  but could work if the players were perfect  but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie  and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in  yolanda and the thief   van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly  even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like levant in  aip    and he provides a lot of amusing moments  but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed off van johnson performance 
"After seeing all the Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawkers,etc films in the fifties, it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director Ang Lee. The scene of the attack of Lawrence, Kansas is awesome. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as the bad guy. All the time this film makes you feel the horror of war, and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours. Definitely worth seeing.",1,after seeing all the jesse james  quantrill  jayhawkers etc films in the fifties  it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee  the scene of the attack of lawrence  kansas is awesome  the romantic relationship between jewel and toby mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys meyers is outstanding as the bad guy  all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war  and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours  definitely worth seeing 
"This movie re-wrote film history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe.

What's not to like about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Only if.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands.

"I give this film it's props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted. BUt I couldn't get past the implausibility of the whole thing.<br /><br />First and foremost, a game built around the notion of ""Russian Roulette"" that has to fill on hour. the big problem is that if you are doing a ""live"" show, you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the ""real"" bullet. Then what do you do? You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. The corollary is that Okay, you get to the end and the first five contestants survive, which means number six has the bullet and can't possibly get the payout. He isn't going to shoot himself at that point, so it's kind of anti-climatic. <br /><br />second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People are going to flinch, panic, soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television. Too much randomness. That's why ""real"" Reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited.<br /><br />(The only random thing is the ""performance artist's"" rant about female sacrifices, which were actually rare historically. Even that was predictable, since she went through with shooting herself to no effect.) <br /><br />We are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 AM in the morning (unlikely) with the token Asian girl announcing each boost in ratings.<br /><br />A point on race and sex. Big surprise the movies two minority (one gay) and two female contestants are the ones who survive. So we are left with the two white males, and of course, the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it. The purpose of such a show would be it's randomness, but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies.<br /><br />the Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide, the Eva Mendes character (Mendes produced and starred in this thing, so she has no one to blame but herself) actually grows a conscience when someone dies. What did she THINK was going to happen? She is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing (motives never explained) and the show went on to be a big hit. Really? <br /><br />the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous (like Network).

"This is one of the few movies I watched twice in the theatre. I really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption. Isn't this a rather consoling thought?<br /><br />When I watched it for the first time, I thought that after the won election, the movie would be over - I didn't know the book. So boy was I wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come! I was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film.<br /><br />Many people here utterly dislike this movie. I cannot understand that one single bit. Maybe those who read the book first are - as often with screen adaptations of novels - simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold, unseen, unexplained. But as a movie telling a touching story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the strength of love and the insanity of hate (and conservatism) - this movie is simply splendid! Furthermore, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons.<br /><br />So definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for!",1,this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre  i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero esteban trueba  he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption  isnt this a rather consoling thought  when i watched it for the first time  i thought that after the won election  the movie would be over   i didnt know the book  so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come  i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film  many people here utterly dislike this movie  i cannot understand that one single bit  maybe those who read the book first are   as often with screen adaptations of novels   simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold  unseen  unexplained  but as a movie telling a touching story   the story of a family  the rise and fall of a man  the deep compassion of a woman  the strength of love and the insanity of hate  and conservatism    this movie is simply splendid  furthermore  the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well   especially winona ryder and jeremy irons  so definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for 
"This is no art-house film, it's mainstream entertainment. <br /><br />Lot's of beautiful people, t&a, and action. I found it very entertaining. It's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun film to watch! Jesse and Chace are funny too, which is just gravy. Definitely worth a rental.<br /><br />So in summary, I'd recommend checking it out for a little Friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl (if she likes to see other girls get it on!)<br /><br />The villains are good too.

"The plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination. However, there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found. Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film, an old man living by himself in a house. During the film I found that I was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit did not engage me; I found the tempo of the film a little too slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, took too long. I feel more could have been made of the relationship, ghostly encounters, with the child and the old man. Alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.",0,the plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods  soft for digging follows the old mans attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination  however  there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found  soft for digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film  an old man living by himself in a house  during the film i found that i was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man  the rest of the film i have to admit did not engage me  i found the tempo of the film a little too slow  the limited dialogue was not a problem  however  the development of the story and its conclusions  after watching the film  took too long  i feel more could have been made of the relationship  ghostly encounters  with the child and the old man  alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations  children are always scary as ghosts  see dark water 
"Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.",1,very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves  i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write  this film simply smacked of the real world  the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter  the live in relatives and their quarrels  the troubled child who gets knocked up and then  typically  drops out of school  a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it  2 thumbs up 
"Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as great as usual. Ritter wasn't bad either. What's her name was as pretty as usual. It could have been a good movie. To bad the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, trite and boring.<br /><br />From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by numbers routine. The characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting, which was a pity.<br /><br />Finally, too bad the script writer wasn't the victim.

"Another case of a decent DVD case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film. <br /><br />It wasn't that bad. Rochon does a serviceable job and Damn! the cast is good looking. I've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis. This movie really wanted to make you think Rochon was the killer, but it was not to be. My biggest problem with the film was that by the end, I didn't much care who was the killer, and the real killer made little sense, since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha, betcha didn't see that one coming, sucker!'. Yeah, there were continuity errors about (mainly with ms. Rochon's ever-changing wardrobe), but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. I was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless, but that was just a gimmick. The dialog was overly think and painful at times.<br /><br />Just don't have high expectations going into this, and it won't be that bad.

"First of all this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the movie is slow and boring. The acting is not bad but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. My final comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film.",0,first of all this movie is not a comedy  unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh  secondly  the movie is slow and boring  the acting is not bad but not special  there is a lucky luke comic about two families  one with big noses and one with big ears  fighting each other in a small town    you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie  religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule  there is a similar subject comedy  the home teachers   this had some good moments  my final comment is  do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film 
"This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. Its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish, with only good/bad characters. The world is just not like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what I HATE most about this film is Bola's friend's father. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average looking dad (wow, this is like... philosophy, or something).

"Like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and ponderous. The producer's last outing, ""Mosquitoman-3D"" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow managed it. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was it's passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface. But even that was only passable. Poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish. With Dolphins and Whales, the technology is all but wasted. Cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's stunning 3D capabilities. There are far too few scenes of any depth or variety. Close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field, so there is no contrast of depth. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you've got Shark-Week on cable, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.",1,like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this films title  michael oblowitzs latest production has grace  but its also slow and ponderous  the producers last outing   mosquitoman 3d  had the same problem  its hard to imagine a boring shark movie  but they somehow managed it  the only draw for hammerhead  shark frenzy was its passable animatronix  which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the oceans surface  but even that was only passable  poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish  with dolphins and whales  the technology is all but wasted  cloudy scenes and too many close ups of the films giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of imaxs stunning 3d capabilities  there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety  close ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field  so there is no contrast of depth  michael oblowitz is trying to follow in his fathers footsteps  but when youve got shark week on cable  his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment 
"I've read most of the comments on this movie. I have seen this movie(and the whole prophecy series) many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times. No one got scared or traumatized like I have read on some posts. The movie is just based on biblical facts. I have seen a lot of end time movies ""Tribulation"", ""Armagedon"" and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths.

"One of the most underrated movies I've seen in a long time, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to look at this film: First, you see dumb dialogue, far fetched plot, juvenile idea. OR.. You see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. Throw a Bruce Willis or a Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie. Bill and Ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity, only it's Bill and Ted. This is a tricky fence to balance on, but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy, but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure, it becomes so much more.",1,one of the most underrated movies ive seen in a long time  bill   teds bogus journey is the second hilarious adventure of bill s  preston esq  and ted theodore logan  aka wyld stallyns  there are two ways to look at this film  first  you see dumb dialogue  far fetched plot  juvenile idea  or   you see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains  throw a bruce willis or a arnold schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie  bill and ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity  only its bill and ted  this is a tricky fence to balance on  but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy  but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure  it becomes so much more 
"This movie had what sounded like a good premise: 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness. What's really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western, and at the end, the twists, of which their were several, don't make sense with the rest of the movie. It seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point. It just didn't make a lot of sense. The only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall, but that doesn't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess.",0,this movie had what sounded like a good premise  9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars  unfortunately  it did not turn out to be a good movie  there are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene  a few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts  the acting is bad  but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness  whats really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western  and at the end  the twists  of which their were several  dont make sense with the rest of the movie  it seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool  while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point  it just didnt make a lot of sense  the only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall  but that doesnt even come close to making up for the rest of this mess 
"I found this film to be an utter dissapointment. The talent available to the director- notably Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main leads)- have been completely wasted on an unfunny, mediocre story, whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is feeble, Zeta-Jones is just plain annoying (appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour), Crystal just plays his same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and Cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project.<br /><br />For what is supposed to be a 'Romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for the comedy- (possible SPOILERS)well, the only moments of mild humour came off the back of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably amusing as the Mexican lover and Walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-Dogme type director- but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead (Spoilers) we were treated to Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. Pure genius.<br /><br />For a huge fan of the majority of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas, and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them, instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost 'gross-out, teen-movie' humour at times.<br /><br />A very poor 4/10.",0,i found this film to be an utter dissapointment  the talent available to the director  notably stanley tucci  chris walken  hank azaria and alan arkin  without even mentioning the four main leads   have been completely wasted on an unfunny  mediocre story  whose conclusion one couldnt really care about once introduced to the dire  stereo typed characters  julia roberts is feeble  zeta jones is just plain annoying  appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity  minus the humour   crystal just plays his same old hyper active  neurotic  annoying alter ego and cusack simply walks through his part  apparently bored with the whole project  for what is supposed to be a romantic comedy  there is absolutely no romance between the central characters  let alone chemistry  and as for the comedy   possible spoilers well  the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusacks role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin  the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever   spoilers  azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse maverick dogme type director  but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead  spoilers  we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog  pure genius  for a huge fan of the majority of john cusacks work  not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast  i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas  and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them  instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost gross out  teen movie humour at times  a very poor 4 10 
"There's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just plain sucks. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. Essentially, what we have here is a feature length episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.",0,theres really no way to beat around the bush in saying this  lady death  the motion picture just plain sucks  aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence  the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980s cartoon based on a line of action figures  the bad guy himself even talks like a skeletor wannabe  has the obligatory inept henchman  and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old saturday morning blackstar cartoon  just dont expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue  at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai  yet there is no sex  no tentacle rape  thank goodness   and very little sex appeal  this despite the physical appearance of the title character  there is simply no adult edge to this material  unless you count the half naked heroine and bloody deaths  essentially  what we have here is a feature length episode of she ra  princess of power  but with skimpier clothes and more gore 
"This period melodrama is one of Griffith's earliest claustrophobic films. Characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and, as time went by, he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror. In the bluntly titled Sealed Room there is one major difference to the normal plot line, in that there truly is no escape.<br /><br />Griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways. First is his use of space. While the typical Biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets, The Sealed Room features only two adjoining rooms  the king's court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb. The set design in these shorts is rarely referenced, but here it is crucial. The court is a large interior, with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase. Actors enter and leave from various directions, suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open. By contrast the dove cote's back wall is very close to the camera, and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined.<br /><br />The second technique on display here is the cross-cutting. Anyone with an interest in Griffith's work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross-cutting to build excitement or tension. Many will also know that strictly speaking it wasn't his invention. However what makes Griffith's cross-cuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other. The Sealed Room contains a good example of what I mean. The shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow, step-by-step pace to them, with tension building as the wall gets higher. This movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers, in which Marion Leonard tears off flower petals one-by-one. As the couple realise their predicament, their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall.<br /><br />At this point, Griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross-cut. The dramatic ""ride-to-the-rescue"", here absent, was later to become a standard climax to Griffith's pictures.",1,this period melodrama is one of griffiths earliest claustrophobic films  characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and  as time went by  he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror  in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line  in that there truly is no escape  griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways  first is his use of space  while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets  the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms  the kings court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb  the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced  but here it is crucial  the court is a large interior  with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase  actors enter and leave from various directions  suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open  by contrast the dove cotes back wall is very close to the camera  and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined  the second technique on display here is the cross cutting  anyone with an interest in griffiths work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross cutting to build excitement or tension  many will also know that strictly speaking it wasnt his invention  however what makes griffiths cross cuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other  the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean  the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow  step by step pace to them  with tension building as the wall gets higher  this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers  in which marion leonard tears off flower petals one by one  as the couple realise their predicament  their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall  at this point  griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross cut  the dramatic  ride to the rescue   here absent  was later to become a standard climax to griffiths pictures 
"First up this film, according to the slick said it won ""best film"" at ""Worldfest"" Film festival in Houston, Texas.

"""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" is yet another 'feel-goody', so-called 'heart warming', and out-for-ratings show that ABC has had the time to put together.<br /><br />I understand the troubles that these families go through. For that, I am sorry. But wouldn't you think that putting four wide-screen plasma televisions, three flat-screen desktop computers, an inground pool taking up half of a backyard, and closets full of expensive designer clothing is a BIT too excessive for ANY family? Sure, these families have been through a lot. Sure, they deserve nicer things that what they had previously had.<br /><br />But honestly, the things that Ty Pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhood.<br /><br />Another thing that really irks me about this show is how Ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family, or the family's condition. Telling a wheelchair-bound person that he or she is 'so strong', or 'very brave' really does get old after a while. That may sound rude, but believe me; watch this show, and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />All in all, this show is overrated. If you want to watch it, go ahead.

Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last that we saw Sheriff Pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed Sunday morning drive. After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes. The only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story. How could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it.

"The title of this obscure and (almost righteously) forgotten 80's slasher inevitably reminds me of The Cure's mega-smash-monster hit song with the same title, hence a piece of the lyrics in the title-section of this user comment. Also, I didn't have anything else to say that was useful, anyway. But hey, ""The Forest"" isn't totally hopeless and not even *that* bad, actually. If nothing else, at least it obeys the, admittedly unwritten, first rule of 80's slasher: kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime. Sure you've heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before, but don't let that discourage you from watching it, as ""The Forest"" has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image. It's actually a bit of an atypical 80's slasher! The main characters aren't ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism. The concept isn't always successful, let alone plausible, but it's more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy. Two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of California, but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands. Barely set up for the night, they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children, the children themselves and finally the father who's out hunting for human flesh. The demented family may be real or imaginary, but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive, they have already vanished. The men too encounter the family, and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background. ""The Forest"" is a weird and unusual film, to say the least. It's not exactly a masterpiece of plotting, but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open-minded fans of 80's horror. The murders are fairly gruesome and will-filmed, including a slit throat and a painful saw-massacre, and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful. The more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists, the less it makes any sense, so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer. The acting performances are just above average, the music is okay and at least director Donald Jones (also responsible for the 70's exploitation-sickie ""Schoolgirls in Chains"") tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80's horror films.

i just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities looked awful. Also the mob characters looked too weird. Warren Beatty didn't do an awful job as Dick Tracy but it was definetely not one of his better performances. Madonna should just stick to singing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 just because of the amazing acting by Al Pacino.

"Acidic, unremitting, and beautiful, John Schlesinger's masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago, when American life was even more disorienting. The film probably could not have been made at any other time in history, because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s: final dissolution of the Great American West, the intensification of war in Vietnam, and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety.<br /><br />'Midnight Cowboy' is widely known as the only Academy Award-winning film to garner an 'X' rating, but there is much more behind its fame; it also exceeds the norm as a work of art. While this film (from the novel by James Leo Herlihy) has much to say about the erosion of American life, it transcends '60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras. The two main characters, in fact, are standard antiheroes - men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world.<br /><br />The initial focus of 'Midnight Cowboy' is on 28-year-old Joe Buck, a physically imposing Texas native played by Jon Voight. In the opening scenes, we follow Joe's bus trip to New York City, where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents - the ability to pleasure women - and earn his fortune as a hustler. We learn upon his arrival that Joe is laughably naïve in the sex trade. Garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as 'one hell of a stud,' the young Texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a sickly con man and petty thief from the Bronx. Ratso, who is short, thin, and with a limp, proves of little monetary help to Joe. They quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months, Joe and Ratso shiver in a condemned Manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names. It is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them, the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Joe hearkens back to earlier years in Texas, including life with his grandmother Sally (Ruth White), who served as guardian; his harried relationship with 'Crazy' Annie (Jennifer Salt), a notorious local girl; and a traumatic event in which Joe and Annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair. Very much of its time, 'Midnight Cowboy' strings together a wild array of flashbacks, dream sequences, and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds. For every moment of understanding we gain from Joe and Ratso, more questions about their lives are generated. Both men are no doubt in tatters; they have no clear sense of direction until Ratso falls into the throes of illness and Joe finally senses a purpose for being alive. This revelation pushes 'Midnight Cowboy' to its conclusion, a rather hopeful one in a very grim story.<br /><br />While Joe and Ratso badly need some luck, the direction of John Schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of Waldo Salt's screenplay in allowing Voight and Hoffman to thrive. Their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast, which features Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro, and members of the Andy Warhol clique, offers itself as an essential part of the storyline. The flashback sequences involving Voight, Ruth White, and Jennifer Salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost.<br /><br />Any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film, thanks to the excellent cinematography of Adam Holender ('The Boy Who Could Fly,' 'Smoke') and editing by Hugh Robertson ('Shaft'). The visuals of 'Midnight Cowboy' work with its soundtrack (assembled by John Barry) as a cohesive unit, sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades. The lead song Everybody's Talking is sung by Nilsson, which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase. The memorable harmonica theme is played by Jean 'Toots' Thielemans.<br /><br />'Midnight Cowboy' has been released in a two-disc collector's edition by MGM/UA, which contains expanded features and commentary. Also available is a 1998 DVD release (used for this review), which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound enhancement; three-language subtitles and closed captioning; French 'dubbing'; a theatrical re-release trailer (not the 'original' as advertised); and an eight-page production booklet. Both DVD editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film, showing its original brilliance. Well-deserving of its three Oscars (best picture, Schlesinger, Waldo Salt) and additional nominations (Voight, Hoffman, Sylvia Miles, Hugh Robertson), 'Midnight Cowboy' will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics.<br /><br />*** ½ out of 4",1,acidic  unremitting  and beautiful  john schlesingers masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago  when american life was even more disorienting  the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history  because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s  final dissolution of the great american west  the intensification of war in vietnam  and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety  midnight cowboy is widely known as the only academy award winning film to garner an x rating  but there is much more behind its fame  it also exceeds the norm as a work of art  while this film  from the novel by james leo herlihy  has much to say about the erosion of american life  it transcends 60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras  the two main characters  in fact  are standard antiheroes   men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world  the initial focus of midnight cowboy is on 28 year old joe buck  a physically imposing texas native played by jon voight  in the opening scenes  we follow joes bus trip to new york city  where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents   the ability to pleasure women   and earn his fortune as a hustler  we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably naïve in the sex trade  garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as one hell of a stud  the young texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with enrico ratso rizzo  dustin hoffman   a sickly con man and petty thief from the bronx  ratso  who is short  thin  and with a limp  proves of little monetary help to joe  they quickly run out of cash and as

"YES, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. YES, the acting does range from average to laughable. YES, it has been done so many times before. However what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. There are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie. In addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing. I urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be; a scary, funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none.",1,yes  the plot is hardly plausible and very thin  yes  the acting does range from average to laughable  yes  it has been done so many times before  however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is  there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie  in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing  i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be  a scary  funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none

"As Steven Segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel. His best was just fodder for bored teenagers. This one tips the scales, then falls off. The characters are all cardboard. The story is double lame. I can't spoil it by telling you the ending. You already know how all Steven Segal movies end if you have seen one. Here goes. He is a super-dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide, instead of killing him, to dope his brain until he don't remember squat. He escapes, of course, gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in Afghanastan by a rogue Air Force pilot who, surprise, surprise, Segal trained. All the heroes, except Segal's character and his dusky girlfriend, die heroically and Steve-Baby save the whole world in one swell foop, or fell swoop. Whatever. Made with some surplus Air Force and Navy flying film. And a lot of boom-booms.

This movie is sort of a Carrie meets Heavy Metal. It's about a highschool guy who gets picked on alot and he totally gets revenge with the help of a Heavy Metal ghost. it is such a classic.

"How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know. ""Gymkata"" is a ridiculous action movie, filled (or is that empty?) with paper-thin plots, dumb characters, and preposterous situations. But take it from me, if you enjoy watching poor, yet goofy, movies, you will enjoy ""Gymkata"" a great deal.<br /><br />The action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see his dad was another quasi-government agent, who has gone missing competing in this game, called, eloquently, ""The Game."" So the gymnast (played blandly by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad.<br /><br />Sounds promising doesn't it? Okay, so it doesn't but still, that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie. They can be found in the movie's strange details. Like the gymnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend, who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie, then all of a sudden begins to talk, and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time! Or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break ""The Game""'s non-existent rules whenever he so pleases. And of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the ""Village of The Crazies"" (Evidently that's the place's real name!). Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.<br /><br />But where this movie really shines is the action scenes. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of Middle Eastern cities, so that our Gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses. It has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />One interesting thing of note. A lot, I'd say about half the cast, dies from being shot with an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie. If these were indeed effects, my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds. More likely, this was the film's way of not paying extras. Nevertheless, ""Gymkata"" deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing.<br /><br />",0,how this movie escaped the wrath of mst3k ill never know   gymkata  is a ridiculous action movie  filled  or is that empty   with paper thin plots  dumb characters  and preposterous situations  but take it from me  if you enjoy watching poor  yet goofy  movies  you will enjoy  gymkata  a great deal  the action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents  at least i think they were government agents  to become a spy  you see his dad was another quasi government agent  who has gone missing competing in this game  called  eloquently   the game   so the gymnast  played blandly by kurt thomas  trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad  sounds promising doesnt it  okay  so it doesnt but still  that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesnt begin to describe the joys of this movie  they can be found in the movies strange details  like the gymnasts mysterious asian girlfriend  who doesnt speak for the first half hour of the movie  then all of a sudden begins to talk  and doesnt shut up for the rest of the time  or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break  the game s non existent rules whenever he so pleases  and of course theres our heros delightful romp through the  village of the crazies   evidently thats the places real name    nice place to visit  but i wouldnt want to live there  but where this movie really shines is the action scenes  since our protagonist is a gymnast  the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of middle eastern cities  so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses  it has to be seen to be believed  one interesting thing of note  a lot  id say about half the cast  dies from being shot with an arrow  interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie  if these were indeed effects  my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds  more likely  this was the films way of not paying extras  nevertheless   gymkata  deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing 
"Deanna Durbin really did save Universal from bankruptcy and enabled it to remain a big studio. By the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at Universal eg Milestone, Browning and Wyler had gone. Only James Whale remained but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in a short ""Every Sunday"" and initially Garland was suggested for the role of Penny in ""Three Smart Girls"". When Garland was unavailable Universal switched to Durbin. Initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by Henry Koster the film had a European touch.<br /><br />The film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in ""Switzerland"". The ""three smart girls"" of the title - three sisters, Joan (Nan Grey), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) are sailing with Penny giving her glorious voice to ""My Heart is Singing"". All is not too well on the home front - their father is planning to remarry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes) so the three girls with the help of their trusty nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and reunite him with their mother. Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as Robert Taylor's stern mother in ""Waterloo Bridge"" (1941).<br /><br />Donna is a gold-digger who, along with her scatty mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For someone with no film experience Deanna is wonderful as Penny, a typical pesky, over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture. When she sings ""Someone to Care for Me"" to her father you will just melt - what a glorious voice she had. She also has one of the funniest lines in the film. When her father consoles her with ""I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow"", she replies ""Oh I can see enough monkeys around here""!!!<br /><br />With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire a ""count"" (Mischa Auer)to romance Donna. They arrange to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix-up Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is mistaken for the count and Donna falls for him (she thinks he owns half of Australia!!!) The plan backfires as he falls for Kay and Donna wants to hasten her marriage to Judson.<br /><br />Penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away. She is taken to the local police station where she charms the cops with her rendition of ""Il Bacio"" (she is trying to convince them she is a young opera singer.) Everything ends happily with their mother (Nella Walker) sailing over to patch things up with their dad and in the meantime Donna makes the acquaintance of the phoney count (Mischa Auer) and sails off to Australia with him.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",1,deanna durbin really did save universal from bankruptcy and enabled it to remain a big studio  by the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at universal eg milestone  browning and wyler had gone  only james whale remained but his prestigious horror films were behind him  deanna and judy garland appeared in a short  every sunday  and initially garland was suggested for the role of penny in  three smart girls   when garland was unavailable universal switched to durbin  initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star  directed by henry koster the film had a european touch  the film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in  switzerland   the  three smart girls  of the title   three sisters  joan  nan grey   kay  barbara read  and penny  deanna durbin  are sailing with penny giving her glorious voice to  my heart is singing   all is not too well on the home front   their father is planning to remarry a younger woman  binnie barnes  so the three girls with the help of their trusty nurse  lucille watson  decide to go to new york and reunite him with their mother  lucille watson is best remembered for her role as robert taylors stern mother in  waterloo bridge   1941   donna is a gold digger who  along with her scatty mother  alice brady   is determined to marry judson craig  charles winninger   for someone with no film experience deanna is wonderful as penny  a typical pesky  over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture  when she sings  someone to care for me  to her father you will just melt   what a glorious voice she had  she also has one of the funniest lines in the film  when her father consoles her with  ill take you to the zoo tomorrow   she replies  oh i can see enough monkeys around here     with the help of bill evans  john king  they decide to hire a  count   mischa auer to romance donna  they arrange to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix up lord michael stuart  ray milland  is mistaken for the count and donna falls for him  she thinks he owns half of australia     the plan backfires as he falls for kay and donna wants to hasten her marriage to judson  penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away  she is taken to the local police station where she charms the cops with her rendition of  il bacio   she is trying to convince them she is a young opera singer   everything ends happily with their mother  nella walker  sailing over to patch things up with their dad and in the meantime donna makes the acquaintance of the phoney count  mischa auer  and sails off to australia with him  highly recommended 
"Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it's in the right hands that is  A Bug's Life is a warm reminder. We walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions.<br /><br />It is only Pixar's second animated feature. The sub-group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie Toy Story. It was a movie which defied convention, re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.<br /><br />After all, it's a film about ants. Well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug's Life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? Surely they jest. However, we forget that in Toy Story, a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter.<br /><br />Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isn't an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters  but they're colourful, they're eclectic, and they're idiosyncratic. And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug's Life from the beginning. We shall start with our main character, and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful Ant Island, he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics.<br /><br />The problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term. Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands; however, it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. The cogs and clockwork in Flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers.<br /><br />If you think about it, A Bug's Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai, or the American remake The Magnificent Seven, in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. In A Bug's Life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl.<br /><br />Much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. Among them are an erudite stick insect (David Hyde Pierce), a side-splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (Dennis Hopper). It's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen, as is the entire movie collectively.<br /><br />As I've said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. What makes A Bug's Life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like. However, it's easy to ignore this fault, and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film.<br /><br />Although A Bug's Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here. Pixar have proved that they're not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood. They raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it's only always by themselves. What more is there to say about A Bug's Life other than: see it; it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at Emeryville, California, but this beats out the lot of its year  and I'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998.<br /><br />8.5/10",1,such a joyous world has been created for us in pixars a bugs life  were immersed in a universe which could only be

"While I don't claim to be any sort of expert in marine life, I must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale (and not even the mother!) having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans! I mean, really! This is basically the whole plot. Richard Harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it, you would feel like demanding your money back.",0,while i dont claim to be any sort of expert in marine life  i must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale  and not even the mother   having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans  i mean  really  this is basically the whole plot  richard harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk  this is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it  you would feel like demanding your money back

"I was really surprised with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.<br /><br />Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?",1,i was really surprised with this movie  going in to the sneak preview  knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer id seen  i thought it was going to be a dude wheres my car kind of crap fest  i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because thats just how movies work  instead i got a smart  surprisingly original movie about a decent  average guy who just never had sex  yes  the film is chock full o sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey look a nipple   but its done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys  all the characters are people you probably know in real life  redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives  i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap  and i was very surprised  yea  its pretty over the top  cmon  its a movie about a 40 year old virgin    but its very smartly done  in the end  youre really pulling for this guy to get laid  which says a lot about the movie because honestly  did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not 
"This anime was underrated and still is. Hardly the dorky kids movie as noted, i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it. One of the better movies released.<br /><br />The animation while not perfect is good, camera tricks give it a 3D feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground-breakers like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view. It's a story to entertain, not to question.<br /><br />Still one of my favourites I come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes. Not to say its a childish movies, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all.",1,this anime was underrated and still is  hardly the dorky kids movie as noted  i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it  one of the better movies released  the animation while not perfect is good  camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon  it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view  its a story to entertain  not to question  still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes  not to say its a childish movies  there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all 
"I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as ""The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen"".<br /><br />Even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it. I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film.<br /><br />The simple answer is - they didn't. Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative. Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them.<br /><br />I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from. But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened.<br /><br />They even change the true meaning of the books title ""Rancid Aluminium"" by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title.<br /><br />A real mess of a film from start to finish.",0,i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as  the worst film i have ever seen   even if you ignore the dodgy accents  low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it  i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film  the simple answer is   they didnt  characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative  even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches its climax you dont care what happens to any of them  i can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from  but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened  they even change the true meaning of the books title  rancid aluminium  by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title  a real mess of a film from start to finish

"I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too.

"Spoilers Following: I picked up the book ""Evil Angels"" when it first came out knowing nothing of the case. Just to give the press and the Austrialian people a break here, I was quite far into it before I began to question the Chamberlain's guilt. The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did. John Bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors (and picked up by the press) of the arterial spray, the actelone (??) plates, Dr. James Cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors, that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up, bloody hand print, etc. all quite convincingly. After all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all. It was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand. To this point, beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials, hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human; people didn't believe it was possible. The public was suspicious of the Seventh Day Adventists, whose origins made them appear to be a cult, and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. Were it not for dedicated, selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony, finding Azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get Lindy out of jail. The book shook me for that reason, and I've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since (excepting OJ of course). I was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better. I've always liked Sam, who I could identify with completely, and Meryl was perfect as always. Beautiful photography, haunting music. I think it's not only a very good, but a very important, movie.

"Strange enough, all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over. I feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work, since Marina Vlady was also Robert Hossein's wife, and the - excellent - jazz music was written by te director's father, André. Under these circumstances, no wonder it was a really good thriller, seen when issued and immediately identified with the music. The suspense was flawless, and maintained throughout until the end. Robert Hossein, at the time one of the best European players, managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director.

"The early career of Abe Lincoln is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real Lincoln, but Fonda, wearing a fake nose, is uncanny as Lincoln, with the voice, delivery, walk, and other mannerisms - exactly as one would imagine Lincoln to have been. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he made with Fonda, is at the top of his form, perfectly evoking early 19th century America. The story focuses on a pair accused of murder that Lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done. The supporting cast includes many of Ford's regulars.

"Written by the writer who penned the excellent Murder Rooms series which chronicled ACD's adventures with Doctor Joseph Bell, I was looking forward to this and I wasn't disappointed. It was quite slow moving, with a lot of emphasis on Doyle's frustration at Sherlock Holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed. It was an interesting character study and very well shot ( on digital video, unusual for a period piece ). The acting was excellent all round, particularly Tim McInnery and Brian Cox although the actor who portrayed ACD, whose name I cannot remember impressed me no end.

"Being an otaku since the days of Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film. Although it has been described as being ""sappy,"" it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do. Since the main character is a female, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to ""macho-man"" tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers. The seiryuu for Noriko, incidentally, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is as 3-dimensional a cartoon can get; her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious ""Homing Laser"" and ""Buster Shield"" (which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true Dracula style) technique. I doubt that scene was meant to be funny, but it cracked me up. Yet all in all, I would rank Gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time.",1,being an otaku since the days of robotech  i can still say that gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time  considering when it was made  the animation is of superior quality  there are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality  although the final episode is in black and white  it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film  although it has been described as being  sappy   it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do  since the main character is a female  it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to  macho man  tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers  the seiryuu for noriko  incidentally  also plays akane in ranma 1 2  noriko is as 3 dimensional a cartoon can get  her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will  the only complaint i have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears  even the gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious  homing laser  and  buster shield   which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true dracula style  technique  i doubt that scene was meant to be funny  but it cracked me up  yet all in all  i would rank gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time 
"Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.<br /><br />What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.<br /><br />The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film.

"This is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that Warner Bros could afford. ...and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s, an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties' exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance. THE SHOW OF SHOWS is pretty gigantic. Vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan-dance after ukulele lunacy after Rin Tin Tin who introduces 'an oriental number'...(!)... and on and on it lumbers, grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality Vitaphone sound. It is far too long, but among it's delirious delights are the awesome ""Singin in the Bathtub"" number created on a scale of which The QE2 architects would be proud...Beatrice Lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty, Nick Lucas, and the never-ending grand finale in two color color...which is all set to the song LADY LUCK. . So keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en-ter-tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort. Row after row of ""Doll"" characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor. I kid you not, there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers, mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes, unable to move (for days, I imagine, during production) whilst this katzenjammer of toy-box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the Ukulele orchestra. Of course I loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions. And so should you...and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill. It is all so demented.",1,this is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that warner bros could afford     and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s  an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance  the show of shows is pretty gigantic  vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan dance after ukulele lunacy after rin tin tin who introduces an oriental number          and on and on it lumbers  grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality vitaphone sound  it is far too long  but among its delirious delights are the awesome  singin in the bathtub  number created on a scale of which the qe2 architects would be proud   beatrice lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty  nick lucas  and the never ending grand finale in two color color   which is all set to the song lady luck    so keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en ter tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort  row after row of  doll  characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor  i kid you not  there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers  mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes  unable to move  for days  i imagine  during production  whilst this katzenjammer of toy box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the ukulele orchestra  of course i loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions  and so should you   and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill  it is all so demented 
"this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it. you have a insecure, troubled and fascinating main character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who is trapped between two (no, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues, we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves. this could be the premise for a fowl movie, full of rigid, cold, uninteresting commentaries. yet director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty. being such a long movie, one cannot but burst into laughing when, after 2 hours of speaking politely, Jean-Pierre Léaud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie. this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary. nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the movie. 3 and 1/2 hours and worthing every minute.",1,this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it  you have a insecure  troubled and fascinating main character  played by jean pierre léaud  who is trapped between two  no  three  women  we listen to his social  philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues  we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves  this could be the premise for a fowl movie  full of rigid  cold  uninteresting commentaries  yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh  ironic and witty  being such a long movie  one cannot but burst into laughing when  after 2 hours of speaking politely  jean pierre léaud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie  this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary  nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of françoise lebrun towards the end of the movie  3 and 1 2 hours and worthing every minute 
"Underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro. Alas: it got lost in all the goo. The scenes of Old Edo -- with the courtesan, drifting on the Sumida, rehearsing and acting in the Nakamura-za -- were all exciting and engaging, taking you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed. The skill, the energy in the audience, the colors of the sets, were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance. What a wasted opportunity! One of the best kabuki actors alive, and he gets lost in the dreck.",0,underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of ichikawa somegoro  alas  it got lost in all the goo  the scenes of old edo    with the courtesan  drifting on the sumida  rehearsing and acting in the nakamura za    were all exciting and engaging  taking you back to an interesting and rich era  the action on the kabuki stage  in which somegoro excels and excites  was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed  the skill  the energy in the audience  the colors of the sets  were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance  what a wasted opportunity  one of the best kabuki actors alive  and he gets lost in the dreck 
"It's really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official ""truth"" and caught so many ""news"" agencies with their pants down. This movie, in my view, deserves every price there is in journalism - it's objective (yes!), courageous and a real ""scoop"". It can do without comment, fake scenes or leading questions - everyone, including Chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words. The filmmakers ""only"" had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling.<br /><br />The Venezuelan elite teaches us ""How to depose of a President and sell it as a victory of democracy"". It's amazing that they lost in the end - so far. From what I know, the biggest TV station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked, they're still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I highly doubt whether George W. or Barack Obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup. But then, they don't have to worry.<br /><br />The fact that the ""Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians"" scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called ""free"" (established) media really has become, or has always been, only more so. An important lesson to anyone interested in what ""really"" goes on in the world.<br /><br />The famous ""objectivity"" challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view, or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse ""us"" - it has been true with the effects of the Atomic bomb, the US secret history of spreading ""democracy"" around the world or the Iraq war that, according to Johns Hopkins, has killed 1,3 million Iraquis by now, not to mention the 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the US. And the US is ready & willing to be more damaging to the Iranians that he was.<br /><br />I'm quite curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague, whether there will be any mention of ""our"" involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot's guerrillas in the 80's, when they had been largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not.<br /><br />All the more reason to turn to the Independent media for balance, if not exposure of fraud.",1,its really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official  truth  and caught so many  news  agencies with their pants down  this movie  in my view  deserves every price there is in journalism   its objective  yes    courageous and a real  scoop   it can do without comment  fake scenes or leading questions   everyone  including chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words  the filmmakers  only  had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling  the venezuelan elite teaches us  how to depose of a president and sell it as a victory of democracy   its amazing that they lost in the end   so far  from what i know  the biggest tv station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked  theyre still broadcasting via cable and satellite  i highly doubt whether george w  or barack obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup  but then  they dont have to worry  the fact that the  chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians  scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so called  free   established  media really has become  or has always been  only more so  an important lesson to anyone interested in what  really  goes on in the world  the famous  objectivity  challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view  or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse  us    it has been true with the effects of the atomic bomb  the us secret history of spreading  democracy  around the world or the iraq war that  according to johns hopkins  has killed 1 3 million iraquis by now  not to mention the 60 000 afghans  in 2003  that are never mentioned  to be objective  saddam hussein was less damaging to his people than the us  and the us is ready   willing to be more damaging to the iranians that he was  im quite curious about the upcoming trial of some khmer rouge leaders before the international tribunal in the hague  whether there will be any mention of  our  involvement in supporting and training pol pots guerrillas in the 80s  when they had been largely defeated by the vietnamese  probably not  all the more reason to turn to the independent media for balance  if not exposure of fraud 
"I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. the film stars molly parker (from my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lukas haas -- who I suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future. The film is funny, heartwarming, features great acting, and beautiful photography. i don't know if the film has distribution, but I hope it does - or will - soon. this is destined to be a real indie gem. it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews! the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening. even without her there... this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival.",1,i had no idea what this movie was until i read about it in the l a  weekly  i generally agree with the reviews in the la weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film  the film stars molly parker  from my favorite television show deadwood  and lukas haas    who i suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future  the film is funny  heartwarming  features great acting  and beautiful photography  i dont know if the film has distribution  but i hope it does   or will   soon  this is destined to be a real indie gem  it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews  the only disappointment was that molly parker wasnt there at the screening  even without her there    this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival 
"The movie ""MacArthur"" begins and ends at Gen. Douglas MacArthur's, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata the US Military Academy of West Point on the Hudson. We see a frail 82 year old Gen.MacArthur give the commencement speech to the graduating class of 1962 about what an honor it is to serve their country. The film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on Gen. MacArthur's brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of WWII on the besieged island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942.<br /><br />Told to leave he island for Australia before the Japanese military invade it Gen. MacArthur for the very first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that he'll be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need MacArthur reluctantly, together with his wife and young son, did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war. It was that reason, his escape under fire from death or captivity by the Japanese, that drove Gen. MacArthur to use all his influence to get FDR two years later to launch a major invasion of the Philippians, instead of the island of Formosa, to back up his promise to both the Philippine people as well as the thousands of US POWS left behind. That he'll return and return with the might of the US Army & Navy to back up his pledge!<br /><br />In the two years up until the invasion of the Philippine Islands Gen. MacArther battered the Japanese forces in the South Pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops into surrender. The General did that suffering far less US Military losses then any other allied commander in the War in the Pacific! <br /><br />It was in 1950/51 in the Korean War that Gen. MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat. After outflanking the advancing North Korean Army in the brilliant and perfectly executed, with the invading US Marines suffering less then 100 casualties, back door or left hook invasion of Inchon Gen. MacArther feeling invincible sent the US/UN forces under his command to the very border, along the Yalu River, of Communist Red China. Told by his subordinates that he's facing the threat of a massive ground attack by Communist Chinese troops Gen. MacArthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the US & UN forces to ribbons. The unstoppable wave after wave of attacking Red Chinese troops forced the US/UN forces to retreat in the ""Big Bug Out"" of 1950 with their very lives, leaving all their equipment behind, across the North Korean border even abandoning the South Korean capital city of Seoul! This turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in US history with the US forces losing a record, in the Korean War, 1,000 lives on the very first day-Nov. 29/30 1950-of the Communist Chinese invasion!<br /><br />Shocked and humiliated in what he allowed, due mostly to his own arrogance, to happened MacArthur went on the offensive not against the advancing Communist Chinese and Noth Koreans forces but his own Commander and Chief Pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done: Launch a full scale invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman who had taken just about enough garbage from Gen. MacArthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out, like MacArthur wanted him to, against the Red Chinese this was the last straw! On April 11, 1951 Pres. Truman unceremoniously relived Gen. MacArthur from his command as Supreme Commander of the US/UN forces in Korea! Pres. Truman's brave but very unpopular decision also, by not going along with MacArthur's total war strategy, prevented a Third World War from breaking out with the Soviet Union-Communist China's ally- who at the time-like the US-had the Atomic Bomb! Pres. Truman''s controversial decision to dump the very popular Gen. MacArthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with his polls numbers so low-in the mid 20's- that he withdrew-in March of that year- from the US Presidential Campaign!<br /><br />In was Gen. MacArthur's misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars. With the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out, like Gen. MacArthur wanted to, against the Red Chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the US USSR & Red China but the entire world! It was that important reality of future war that Gen. MacArthur was never taught, since the A and H Bomb weren't yet invented, in West Point.<br /><br />Back to 1962 we can now see that Gen. MacArthur, after finishing his commencement speech at West Point, had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as , since his retirement from the US Military, elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it. One thing that Gen. MacArthur was taught at an early age, from his Civil War General dad Douglas MacArthur Sr, that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very last-not first-resort in settling issues between nations. In that it's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. It took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, for Gen. MacArthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, like himself, really was!",1,the movie  macarthur  begins and ends at gen  douglas macarthurs

"Admittedly, I know nothing about baseball, I'm not even a fan of the sport, but that didn't stop me enjoying the Farrelly brothers' latest film, Fever Pitch, a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy. The film is not really about baseball; rather, it's really about relationships, and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place.<br /><br />Jimmy Fallen  giving his best performance to date  stars as Ben, a dorky, lightly nerdy schoolteacher. Ben is a kind of man-boy, who unfortunately has never really grown up, and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. Ben has devoted his life to the Sox, and does everything from making the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia.<br /><br />One day, while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office, Ben meets the go-getting Lindsey (a wonderful Drew Barrymore). Lindsey is a corporate, career orientated kind of girl, but she has a kind of cuteness that Ben finds totally endearing. He's initially hesitant to ask her out, thinking that she's way out of his ""class,"" and, Lindsey doesn't immediately see a potential partner in Ben.<br /><br />Their first date gets off to a disastrous start when Lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning  and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are, in fact, watching a Farrelly brothers movie. Rather than accept Lindsey's - rather urgent - request to reschedule, Ben sticks around to play nurse, orderly, and janitor. So Ben scrubs the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed.<br /><br />When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch, she begins the long, fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards. Soon they are falling in love, with Lindsey blithely accepting Ben's fanatical devotion to his sport.<br /><br />Having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle, Ben has organized his life around the season  he's never missed a game. But their relationship, which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter, hits a snag at the start of the season.<br /><br />Lindsey wants Ben to do other things, like holiday with her parents and party with her friends, but Ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet Lindsey halfway. Can Lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work? Can she really accommodate Ben's infatuation with sports? Can a die-hard and nerdy Red Sox fan find true love after all? Of course, Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion-wielding friends. Lindsey's strictest buddy, the skinny, rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strickland), insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he's still single at 30. However, plump, curly-haired Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione Skye) supply a more optimistic and positive view of Ben.<br /><br />Ben's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay's frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman. Fallon is terrific as Ben, exhibiting real big screen potential, overcoming the not-insignificant challenge of keeping Ben from being unsympathetic. Barrymore, meanwhile, is equally charming as the workaholic Lindsey, particularly as she struggles to accept Ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs.<br /><br />Fever Pitch really works, and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments, the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory.<br /><br />Much of the movie was filmed at Boston's Fenway Park, which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings, as well as the ambiance of the games, though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados. Even so, Fever Pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect.

"Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about that movie.Even if B. Mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun Eurotrash director. But for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it.This film is just empty, nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min.No sex, no blood(it's suppose to be about snuff?),no actors, no dialogs, just as bad as an 90'T.V film.It's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics.So Rest in peace Bruno, you will stay in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as:Zombi 3, Robowar,Rats, l'altro inferno,Virus, Cruel jaws and few others.So except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by jess Franco's spirit's new film, pass on this one.But if you don't know this nice artisan's career track down his old films and have fun.",0,unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that theres nothing to spoil about that movie even if b  mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director  but for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it this film is just empty  nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min no sex  no blood its suppose to be about snuff   no actors  no dialogs  just as bad as an 90t v film its even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics so rest in peace bruno  you will stay in our minds forever anyway  thanks to such unforgettable gems as zombi 3  robowar rats  laltro inferno virus  cruel jaws and few others so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess francos spirits new film  pass on this one but if you dont know this nice artisans career track down his old films and have fun 
"This is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life. The pacing, the camera work, the emotion, the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see. It isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted. The only flaw I can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the very finest sound format available.(An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter.) The gorgeous Italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film. I can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite. The transformations of the characters from contained, tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often.<br /><br />The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is above reproach. It is a film about middle age and the choices people make.It is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness. Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you. If you don't get it, perhaps you haven't lived enough, or something else is wrong with you.",1,this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life  the pacing  the camera work  the emotion  the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see  it isnt easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted  the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasnt captured in a more technically perfect film format  it deserved todd ao  technicolor and the very finest sound format available  an intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter   the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard  as it is  it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film  i cant stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite  the transformations of the characters from contained  tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more often  the casting is perfect  the mood is perfect  the acting is above reproach  it is a film about middle age and the choices people make it is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness  watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you  if you dont get it  perhaps you havent lived enough  or something else is wrong with you 
"Kurt Russell IS Elvis, plain and simple. His dedication to this role resulted in what I think, is the best movie bio ever. If you're an Elvis fan, see it if you can.<br /><br />The made-for-television film was made two years after Elvis' death.<br /><br />One piece of advice, there are two versions - one at 180 minutes and one at 117 minutes. The only one to watch is the longer one. The shorter one has more than one hour of footage edited out. It just does not work because the scenes in it are often dependent on the scenes that were cut.<br /><br />This masterpiece takes you from Elvis childhood through his emergence as entertainment's greatest star. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real dad) are excellent as Elvis' parents. And Pat Hingle delivers a very competent Col.

"""The house of the spirits"" is quite awful. I live in South America, in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe, and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality, this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid. Things are not so simple and linear as appears here, and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in ""The house..."". If you can't show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all. There are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema, without so many commonplaces. In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public's intelligence.",0, the house of the spirits  is quite awful  i live in south america  in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe  and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality  this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid  things are not so simple and linear as appears here  and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in  the house      if you cant show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all  there are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema  without so many commonplaces  in some parts i felt that carmen miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees  when you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your publics intelligence 
"I recently watched Spirit and enjoyed it very much, I've seen it about 4 times now on HBO and will buy the DVD. Those who gave negative reviews would probably think that `Vanishing Point' was just another car chase movie and `Thelma & Louise' was just another chick flick. Although the conclusions of those films are darker I feel the themes are somewhat related; that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you. The other common trait of these movies is the caring, thoughtful `guardian angel' types who help the main characters to overcome adversity.<br /><br />Another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone else's home. All one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that.<br /><br />I thought the animation and the story were amazing, the animators really got the horses to look, act and move naturally. Spirit's emotions were very clear as the story progressed (yes I'm aware they do humanize the horses a bit, but this is fiction). In a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire. In other more quiet scenes (which are most of the time) you're allowed to savor the backgrounds. One of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking, singing animals route. Doing so would take away from the story's power. Instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character, further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack. Another plus is that they weren't afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side (which really made this film watchable to me). This isn't prevalent through the entire movie though, and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy.<br /><br />Those who appreciate horses will really like this movie, but I think it's a bit more than a horse movie. I don't feel this would be a good movie to take children to if they're brought up on the inane fare that's offered up today. But if they're the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like The Lord of the Rings and Black Beauty they'll likely love this movie.

"I am not saying that Night of the Twisters was horrible, but it was far from great. Mediocre at absolute best. I seems though that every time one type of movie is released, a second must be around the same time. (Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Night of the Twisters is really just Twister except worse and with mundane special effects.<br /><br />I have nothing against the actors who starred in it, even if they weren't great, it was the movie itself, the directing, the special effects, the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage.<br /><br />I really don't know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other, but this one would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.",0,i am not saying that night of the twisters was horrible  but it was far from great  mediocre at absolute best  i seems though that every time one type of movie is released  a second must be around the same time   think about armageddon and deep impact  volcano and dantes peak  night of the twisters is really just twister except worse and with mundane special effects  i have nothing against the actors who starred in it  even if they werent great  it was the movie itself  the directing  the special effects  the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret  a series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage  i really dont know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other  but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt

"Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient. For example, a central theme in the story is young France's inability to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly, notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France's return to her childhood home, the girl's lack of intimacy with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development (or lack thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot. The film raises a great deal of tension between characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in her life, but never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The final few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint, but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.",1,claire deniss chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film  the film presents a very interesting look at the household of a european colonial family living in cameroon  giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction  however  the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient  for example  a central theme in the story is young frances inability to form strong relationships with others  although this portrayal is executed flawlessly  notably in the way that denis frames the story with scenes from frances return to her childhood home  the girls lack of intimacy with the films other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development  or lack thereof  as a protagonist  the general stagnation of the films character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot  the film raises a great deal of tension between characters  particularly between aimee and the men in her life  but never fully addresses this social friction  leaving the viewer unsatisfied  the final few scenes are powerful but depressing  deniss work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint  but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama  chocolat is definitely not the best choice 
I thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first. It wouldn't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money. The movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I wasn't expecting Justin Timberlake to do that good a job. Considering it is his first movie he did a good job. This is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night. It should go pretty well. The cast was great. So I highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out!,1,i thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first  it wouldnt have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money  the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world  justin timberlake did a good job  i wasnt expecting justin timberlake to do that good a job  considering it is his first movie he did a good job  this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just dont know what you want to rent that night  it should go pretty well  the cast was great  so i highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out 
"First off, I really loved Henry Fool, which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers. Parker Posey is one of best actresses on-screen today. But this film was a full-out travesty. Watching Hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras - so full of pride, and making pointless analogies to Star Wars - was stomach-turning. This was hype on the producers part (HDNET) realized to the max. A true example of the Emperor and his new clothes. Mostly I feel that Hal has spoiled HENRY FOOL forever. I don't think I can ever see it again in it's pure, innocent light.<br /><br />Remember Hal, you can FOOL some of the people some of the time... etc. The director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage. Sadly, it's a pure example of the lesson taught in the film ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or its box-office hopes are dim indeed. Never mind a decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to act in a straitjacket.<br /><br />The score, I believe Hartley's, is tasteless. With drum hits walking all over dialog. There was one Apple Soundtrack loop I recognized that gave me a smile.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they're just trying to grab a new audience. But it's really this ridiculous ride. I'd be happy to spoil this movie for you, but it's been done. It's rotten. The FOOL franchise is dead.

"Unremittingly bleak and depressing, the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised Houellebecq's controversial novel of the same name. Like many French films, its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow - or should that be, slowly painful? While this is an excellent and challenging film, it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the 'right' mood to see it.",1,unremittingly bleak and depressing  the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised houellebecqs controversial novel of the same name  like many french films  its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow   or should that be  slowly painful  while this is an excellent and challenging film  it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the right mood to see it 
"Deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven, and Diane Lane) who are invited back to spend a week to Tomawka, a camp in (Ontario) Canada by their former consuelor (Alan Arkin). Writer/director Mike Binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense. Also, the movie has plenty of funny moments, some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite, the one involves using masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel (""The Usual Suspects"", ""Three Kings"") provides the film with some impressive shots of the Canadian wilderness. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, director of ""THE EVIL DEAD"" films and ""The Gift"", appears here as Arkin's bumbling right-hand man.

"Camera work - Why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy? This is annoying and distracting. Editing - the Flashes of the still pictures were way too short. Many of the other scenes were too short also. Just flashes. Sound - the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices. One should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said. Doesn't anybody check these things and make them do it over again. Please reduce the volume of the background music in future. Is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor, Julia Wong? The plot had way too many loose ends. The basic story line had potential. I think the film needed more work. Was it rushed? Perhaps they ran out of money. Like a lot of movies, it started out great but just petered out toward the end. I really don't understand this, you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn't all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard.<br /><br />Sorry to be so critical.",0,camera work   why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy  this is annoying and distracting  editing   the flashes of the still pictures were way too short  many of the other scenes were too short also  just flashes  sound   the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices  one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said  doesnt anybody check these things and make them do it over again  please reduce the volume of the background music in future  is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor  julia wong  the plot had way too many loose ends  the basic story line had potential  i think the film needed more work  was it rushed  perhaps they ran out of money  like a lot of movies  it started out great but just petered out toward the end  i really dont understand this  you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesnt all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard  sorry to be so critical 
"Three girls (an all-female media-crew, including cult-actress Barbara Bach, no less) visiting a small town to cover a festival, end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague. Well-made little shocker, suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue-scenes and a rather thin plot-line (that doesn't do very well in hiding its secrets). One underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing (as in: vintage shock-material), and this is basically what the film thrives on. Performances & cinematography are pretty much above par (compared to many other late 70's/early 80's films in the same vein), but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax-scene in the basement-setting. From the moment that ""Keller Junior"" character was introduced, his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn't close until the end of the film.

"Possible Spoilers, Perhaps. I must say that ""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True"" is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all, the movie was made during the height of Disney's sequel rampage. It was created around the same time as ""The Little Mermaid II,"" ""The Jungle Book II,"" and ""Peter Pan II,"" all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (Disney also made ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame II"" and ""Atlantis II,"" but I'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place."") Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney ""Cinderella."" The sequel to ""Cinderella,"" however, was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, ""I'm going to do this banquet my way!"" Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I have affectionately named her) says, ""Ewww!"" That is the anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original ""Cinderella"" when making this sequel? Well, it surely doesn't seem so. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first one, Anastasia was evil. In the second one, she is good. One just can't leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming Walt Disney's name.

"I never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. I always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's. But after I saw on the internet that this was meant for the TV, I was shocked because for a television film, it is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />The thing that mostly concerned me was the length. I felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary. Also, it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end. <br /><br />On the plus side, there is a strong, very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a bit haggard.

"I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination on display, the visual interpretation of the script, the humor is constantly surprising. The two leads are great and really carry the film. My advice would be to not even watch a trailer, just rent the film and watch without expectations. I rented from blockbuster, so it is readily available in brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that's always good, unless it's just 'that was stupid'. I loved this film, you just don't get to see gem's like this every day. This should become a cult favorite. Give it a try, you may just feel the same way about it as i do.",1,i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience  the imagination on display  the visual interpretation of the script  the humor is constantly surprising  the two leads are great and really carry the film  my advice would be to not even watch a trailer  just rent the film and watch without expectations  i rented from blockbuster  so it is readily available in brisbane  not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and thats always good  unless its just that was stupid  i loved this film  you just dont get to see gems like this every day  this should become a cult favorite  give it a try  you may just feel the same way about it as i do 
"New York police detective Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life. The strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals, leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law. He has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used. Dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals. He is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence.<br /><br />When a rich Texan is murdered following an evening's gambling run by gangster Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill), Dixon is assigned to the case. Scalise tells Dixon's superior officer Detective Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden) that the victim had been accompanied by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his wife Morgan (Gene Tierney) and that Paine had committed the murder. Dixon goes to Paine's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when Paine punches him, Dixon retaliates and Paine collapses and dies. Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river. Paine's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at Scalise's place, adds that her father had gone to Paine's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she'd returned home with facial bruising. Paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), had threatened that if it happened again he would beat Paine up. This information leads to Taylor being arrested and charged with murder. Nobody accepts Dixon's explanation that Scalise had killed the Texan and then had Paine killed to eliminate him as a witness.<br /><br />Dixon continues to make various attempts to get Scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in Paine's death and the cover up. He does this and also records that he is going alone to confront Scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for Dixon's murder. The confrontation with Scalise and the eventual means by which Dixon achieves his own redemption, provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller.<br /><br />Dana Andrews' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow Paine's accidental death. Dixon, however, isn't the only one to experience misfortune as Morgan, a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her. Her father, who'd some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police, unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit. Ken Paine who'd been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and Scalise who'd been set up in business by Dixon's father also suffers his own misfortunes.<br /><br />""Where The Sidewalk Ends"" is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity.",1,new york police detective mark dixon  dana andrews  is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life  the strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals  leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law  he has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used  dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals  he is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his fathers reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence  when a rich texan is murdered following an evenings gambling run by gangster tommy scalise  gary merrill   dixon is assigned to the case  scalise tells dixons superior officer detective lieutenant thomas  karl malden  that the victim had been accompanied by ken paine  craig stevens  and his wife morgan  gene tierney  and that paine had committed the murder  dixon goes to paines apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when paine punches him  dixon retaliates and paine collapses and dies  dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river  paines wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at scalises place  adds that her father had gone to paines apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that shed returned home with facial bruising  paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father  jiggs taylor  tom tully   had threatened that if it happened again he would beat paine up  this information leads to taylor being arrested and charged with murder  nobody accepts dixons explanation that scalise had killed the texan and then had paine killed to eliminate him as a witness  dixon continues to make various attempts to get scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in paines death and the cover up  he does this and also records that he is going alone to confront scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for dixons murder  the confrontation with scalise and the eventual means by which dixon achieves his own redemption  provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller  dana andrews strained and preoccupied expressions convey his characters perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow paines accidental death  dixon  however  isnt the only one to experience misfortune as morgan  a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her  her father  whod some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police  unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit  ken paine whod been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and scalise whod been set up in business by dixons father also suffers his own misfortunes   where the sidewalk ends  is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity

"The original animated Dark Knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its coolness. There's a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, so much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin.<br /><br />There's a new crime-fighter on the streets of Gotham. She dresses like a bat but she's not a grown-up Batgirl. And Batman is denying any affiliation with her. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. But the Penguin, Bain and the local Mob makes things little more complicated.<br /><br />I didn't have high hopes for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn't featured so much here!)but I was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces, the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor. This is definitely a movie no fan of Batman should be without. Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called 'Betcha Neva' which is featured prominently through-out.<br /><br />It's a shame the DVD isn't so great. Don't get me wrong there are some great features (the short 'Chase Me' is awesome) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in 1.85:1 but this DVD is presented in 1.33:1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there IS picture cut off on both sides. I find this extremely annoying considering Mask of Phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen. Warner have had to re-release literally dozens of movies on DVD because people have complained about the lack of Original Aspect Ratio available on some titles. Why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me.<br /><br />I would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 4/5.

"I think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made, When I saw the trailer on TV i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but I somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends, I walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film. The so-called ""jokes"" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. The characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped.

"""Private Practice"" is being spun off the fairly successful and well written ""Grey's Anatomy"". The cast is fabulous. The premise might even work. But the writing is just terrible.<br /><br />The pre-pilot disguised as a Grey's Anatomy episode should have been my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was a fluke. So I set the DVR to tape the pilot and all other episodes.<br /><br />As I was watching the pilot, I just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more. There's supposed to be excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Amazingly, this show had none of that.<br /><br />Thinking it was a fluke, I just watched the second episode hoping for the best. And although marginally better, it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss TV.<br /><br />I just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch. Not worth the effort IMO, and I would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season.

"Max had the V-8, Trace (Wheels of Fires last and only hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland. Be amazed as Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work.<br /><br />Why is WoF set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple, The Road Warrior was! Actually any questions can be answered by: it was that way in the Road Warrior! Except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60's The Time Machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non-vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes.<br /><br />In typical 80's fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion. Inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them. Along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film. Generally I waited for Trace's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough, which comes off more as him looking constipated. Badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker. The unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.<br /><br />Rats: Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior. And that in and of itself is saying a lot! By this count 2020 Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A poor Road Warrior knock off that doesn't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable.<br /><br />",0,max had the v 8  trace  wheels of fires last and only hero  has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland  be amazed as mad max 2  aka the road warrior  is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work  why is wof set in a post apocalyptic wasteland  simple  the road warrior was  actually any questions can be answered by  it was that way in the road warrior  except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60s the time machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes  in typical 80s fashion  all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion  inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them  along with this 80s cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film  generally i waited for traces rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough  which comes off more as him looking constipated  badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker  the unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin  rats  nights of terror by bruno mattei is superior  and that in and of itself is saying a lot  by this count 2020 texas gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to wheels of fire  a poor road warrior knock off that doesnt have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable 
"Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzle film. It has all the pieces of acting, direction, storyline, and entertainment value. They all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece, Fay Grim.<br /><br />This film follows a single mother Fay Grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing. Soon the CIA contacts Fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband Henry's. These journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the CIA and his involvement with countries and their government doings. Fay is sent to find these journals, in return to release her brother from prison, and is sent on a cat-and-mouse chase all over Europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about.<br /><br />Parker Posey had already been an actress I liked after I watched her in The OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers, but Fay Grim was a far different role than the other two movies. Posey made me believe what was happening on screen, I felt for her, I rooted for her, and I wanted to know more. She grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you can't stop thinking about what is happening to her.<br /><br />I haven't seen any other previous works by writer/director Hal Hartley but I believe I will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as Fay Grim was.<br /><br />If you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a DVD I'd highly urge you to choose Fay Grim. If you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely.",1,fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film  it has all the pieces of acting  direction  storyline  and entertainment value  they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece  fay grim  this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing  soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband henrys  these journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government doings  fay is sent to find these journals  in return to release her brother from prison  and is sent on a cat and mouse chase all over europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about  parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show  she brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers  but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies  posey made me believe what was happening on screen  i felt for her  i rooted for her  and i wanted to know more  she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you cant stop thinking about what is happening to her  i havent seen any other previous works by writer director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was  if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd id highly urge you to choose fay grim  if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely

"No, it's not the horror movie...This one is actually a love story.<br /><br />The Ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them. She loves the boxer known as ""One Round"" Jack. She loves him until the champion comes along, that is. Even though she marries One Round, she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between One Round and the champion. She comes back to One Round's corner, just when things look their bleakest, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back.<br /><br />This film was very early in Hitch's career, but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film. Although there are special film tricks, and some comedy relief, this film just does not hold up to any of his later work. It must have been extremely risqué for the time period though, with the shameless adulterous wife. That may have been the draw back in 1927. While looking through all of these old films, it is amazing how I think that they could be redone on today's screen and really come off. Maybe I should be the one....<br /><br />Skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of Hitchcock's films. You could fall asleep in the middle.",0,no  its not the horror movie   this one is actually a love story  the ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them  she loves the boxer known as  one round  jack  she loves him until the champion comes along  that is  even though she marries one round  she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion  she comes back to one rounds corner  just when things look their bleakest  and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back  this film was very early in hitchs career  but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film  although there are special film tricks  and some comedy relief  this film just does not hold up to any of his later work  it must have been extremely risqué for the time period though  with the shameless adulterous wife  that may have been the draw back in 1927  while looking through all of these old films  it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on todays screen and really come off  maybe i should be the one     skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcocks films  you could fall asleep in the middle 
"Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special.<br /><br />If you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the film. They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers.<br /><br />I've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this film dwells, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing. Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting. It doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it.<br /><br />Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.",1,although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special  if youve never seen this film before youll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers  i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disneys aladdin cribbed from the film  they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers  ive given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten  which is where a good portion of this film dwells  because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing  everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end  from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting  it doesnt kill the film  but it does weaken it  still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale  or even a great movie 
"... and yet, we were told, there was another hour and 20 minutes left to go.<br /><br />Why, oh, why wasn't there an editor to tell the writer/director to snip, snip, snip? Apparently that writer/director has previously done shorts; as a short, this would have been okay. But the lack of dialogue starts to grate after twenty minutes. The lack of much music glares. The background noises (talking, traffic, and especially a ubiquitous helicopter) get old really fast. But the worst failure is in story. There is precious little beyond a short.<br /><br />After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I nearly screamed at the screen, ""We get it, we get it!!!!!"" It's amazing that after that left the theatre, we could drive home, watch the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, get ready for bed,and know that the audience was STILL trapped in the theatre.<br /><br />It's not enough to indulge your vision.

"First things first, this movie is achingly beautiful. A someone who works on 3D CG films as a lighter/compositor, the visuals blew me away. Every second I was stunned by what was on screen As for the story, well, it's okay. It's not going to set the world on fire, but if you like your futuristic Blade Runner-esquire tales (and who doesn't?) then you will be fine.<br /><br />I do have to say that I felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole. I saw it at the cinema in English, but I am hoping that there is a French version floating around somewhere.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing.",1,first things first  this movie is achingly beautiful  a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lighter compositor  the visuals blew me away  every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story  well  its okay  its not going to set the world on fire  but if you like your futuristic blade runner esquire tales  and who doesnt   then you will be fine  i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole  i saw it at the cinema in english  but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewhere  definitely worth seeing 
"I don't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but I enjoyed this one as I'm a fan of urban horror. There's not too many urban horror movies out there so when I saw this one on the shelf, just the title alone peaked my curiosity. So I decided to check it out and I was surprised...it's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with GREAT acting and a good story. Is it low budget? yes. Can you tell that it's low budget? Yes...but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter. I like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice! I don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film. All I hear is ""worst movie ever"". Have these idiots seen EVERY movie out there? There's thousands of movies out there, how can you categorize one as the ""worst"" ever? A video not ""movie"" like ""zombiez"" may be the worst film I ever SEEN but I can't say that it's the worst movie EVER since I haven't seen every movie out there. Bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs. Listen, if you don't like minority based, urban films, the ghetto films, hip hop,etc then WHY WATCH THESE TYPES OF MOVIES???!!! knowing that you don't like this type of stuff? Sure, this is a horror film but it's not just a horror film but it's an URBAN horror film with a multi-cultural based cast. I don't like TV shows like Dawson's Creek or the O.C., THEY SUCK to me. Films like ""Garden State"", ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""I heart huckabees"" SUCK to me. I'm a guy from New Jersey and these shows and movies suck to me. Why? Because I can't relate to them. They don't peak my interest. Just common sense. Believe me, I will never watch GARDEN STATE 2: GARDEN SALAD, WEDDING CRASHERS 2: Here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and I HEART HUCKABORING. Now back to this movie, in regards to saint405's comment above, I don't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked ""stupid"" by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me, everyone did a great job. The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a VERY good job. I'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and I had to do a play where I had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so I give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off. Anywho, I liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet I'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this, BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!

"One of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is taking a well-known, classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes the enduring Phantom of the Opera storyline and moves it into a late '80s shopping mall. However, the ""Phantom's"" goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family. The special effects do provide a good chuckle, especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect, mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV fame had not yet arrived. If you're looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew, check this flick out.

"Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once, when it was first televised in 1971. Certain scenes linger in my memory and an overall feeling of disquiet is how I remember being affected by it. I would be fascinated to see it again, if it was ever made available for home video.<br /><br />Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters might have been derived from a 1960 British movie, originally titled City of the Dead, retitled Horror Hotel for the American release? There are some similarities also to a later British film The Wicker Man.<br /><br />One detail remains with me years after seeing the film. It's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film. As I recall, a minister and his wife have stopped to aid some people by the side of the road, circa 1870, somewhere out West. The friendly seeming Ray Milland introduces himself and his ( daughter?), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young mute woman. While the preacher is helping Ray Milland with the wagon, a rattlesnake slithers into view and coils menacingly, unobserved by any of the characters except Yvette Mimieux. She doesn't look scared at all, but stares at the snake with silent concentration, until it goes away. With this strange little moment, we already realize there's something highly unusual about these seemingly normal folks, though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time.<br /><br />That one little scene stays with me vividly after all these years, along with many others. The film has a haunting quality about it that won't let go, and it's not surprising that people remember it so vividly.

"First I would like to say how great this. It is astounding and sometimes shocking. And to say the least I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring film, but this is anything but boring. It is like a trip through humanity. Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find Joe a job which results in stealing food. As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is. They can't get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratso's dream spot, Florida. The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film.

"To ""Bend It Like Beckham"" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to ""Hit it Like Bonds"" or ""Dunk it Like Jordan."" Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player David Beckham does, much like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), does in the film Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. After satisfying the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. The movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.",1,to  bend it like beckham  may not mean much to us americans who know very little about the other football  soccer   but to english sports fans  it is equivalent to  hit it like bonds  or  dunk it like jordan   any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal  much like star player david beckham does  much like the young indian girl  jess  parminder nagra   does in the film bend it like beckham  jess loves to play pick up soccer games  the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother  however  while playing one day  a passing friend named jules  keira knightley  sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling  all girls soccer team  after satisfying the coach joe  jonathan rhys meyers   she makes the team  something she knows her mother would not approve of  the movie is not about disobeying parents  but rather a girl doing what she wants to do  even if that goes against culture  not just the parents  there is humor thrown throughout the movie  especially when jules mother thinks shes a lesbian  the movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment  as the big soccer game is the same day as jess sisters wedding  but it does not come off a cheesy  but rather fun and light  the soccer action looks good  so sports fans will enjoy it  and a story about girls growing up in a boys world  the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience  bend it like beckham is not just about soccer  but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time  something that proves to be rather difficult 
"This 1984 version of the Dickens' classic `A Christmas Carol,' directed by Clive Donner, stars George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. By this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film Donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it. He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially Scott. One could argue that the definitive portrayal of Scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction, ever-- was created by Alastair Sim in the 1951 film; but I think with his performance here, Scott has now achieved that distinction. There is such a purity and honesty in his Scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen Scott do it; simply put, he IS Scrooge. And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous. It is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well, to be able to make a character so real, from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face, and to make it all ring so true. It's a study in perfection.<br /><br />The other members of the cast are splendid as well, but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of Scott's performance; and they do. Frank Finlay is the Ghost of Jacob Marley; a notable turn, though not as memorable, perhaps, as the one by Alec Guinness (as Marley) in the film, `Scrooge.' Angela Pleasence is a welcome visage as the Spirit of Christmas Past; Edward Woodward, grand and boisterous, and altogether convincing as the Spirit of Christmas Present; and Michael Carter, grim and menacing as the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come.<br /><br />David Warner hits just the right mark with his Bob Cratchit, bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by Scott's Scrooge, and Susannah York fares just as well as Mrs. Cratchit. The real gem to be found here, though, is the performance of young Anthony Walters as Tiny Tim; it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin, and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film.<br /><br />The excellent supporting cast includes Roger Rees (Fred Holywell, and also the narrator of the film), Caroline Langrishe (Janet Holywell), Lucy Gutteridge (Belle), Michael Gough (Mr. Poole) and Joanne Whalley (Fan). A flawless presentation, this version of `A Christmas Carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no matter how many versions you may have seen, watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever. And forever after, whenever you think of Scrooge, the image your mind will conjure up will be that of George C. Scott. A thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience, this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home. I rate this one 10/10.",1,this 1984 version of the dickens classic  a christmas carol  directed by clive donner  stars george c  scott as ebenezer scrooge  by this time around  the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again  and  happily to say  with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it  he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail  and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative  especially scott  one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge   one of the best known characters in literary fiction  ever   was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film  but i think with his performance here  scott has now achieved that distinction  there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once youve seen scott do it  simply put  he is scrooge  and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor  to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous  it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well  to be able to make a character so real  from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face  and to make it all ring so true  its a study in perfection  the other members of the cast are splendid as well  but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scotts performance  and they do  frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley  a notable turn  though not as memorable  perhaps  as the one by alec guinness  as marley  in the film   scrooge  angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past  edward woodward  grand and boisterous  and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present  and michael carter  grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come  david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit  bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scotts scrooge  and susannah york fares just as well as mrs  cratchit  the real gem to be found here  though  is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim  its heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin  and simply one of the best interpretations   and the most real   ever presented on film  the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees  fred holywell  and also the narrator of the film   caroline langrishe  janet holywell   lucy gutteridge  belle   michael gough  mr  poole  and joanne whalley  fan   a flawless presentation  this version of  a christmas carol sets the standard against which all others must be gauged  no matter how many versions you may have seen  watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever  and forever after  whenever you think of scrooge  the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c  scott  a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience  this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home  i rate this one 10 10 
"Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, take a trip to Thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college. It seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land, until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their luggage. They get nabbed by the local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the U.S.<br /><br />This is the main story line for ""Brokedown Palace"" and it was a good one. The film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations. Actually, the portrayal was rather mild, as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted. It serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is, it is pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the story. The whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy. To think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra, and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything brought in from visitors, assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter blockheads.<br /><br />The story also fails to bring closure to the nagging question of how the drugs got in Alice's (Claire Danes) backpack. Did she actually agree to transport the drugs? We are left to guess. It was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls' innocence throughout the film, but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty. Except for this considerable flaw, the ending was excellent and the results unexpected.<br /><br />The acting by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done. Danes, who has been oversold and over hyped, actually arrived as an actor in this film. Though her portrayal was frequently immature (as was her character), she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire. Beckinsale, in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goody-two-shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison. Her's was the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Bill Pullman was miscast as the lawyer. His wry and diffident style is an asset in films like ""While You Were Sleeping"", but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong personality.<br /><br />The tourist's look at Thailand was interesting, but it didn't make me want to go there.<br /><br />Overall, an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes. I gave it a 7/10.",1,two adventurous teenagers  best friends  take a trip to thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college  it seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land  until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to hong kong and puts drugs in their luggage  they get nabbed by the local police and find that justice in asia is very different from justice in the u s  this is the main story line for  brokedown palace  and it was a good one  the film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations  actually  the portrayal was rather mild  as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted  it serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is  it is pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world  unfortunately  there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the story  the whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy  to think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra  and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything brought in from visitors  assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter blockheads  the story also fails to bring closure to the nagging question of how the drugs got in alices  claire danes  backpack  did she actually agree to transport the drugs  we are left to guess  it was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls innocence throughout the film  but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty  except for this considerable flaw  the ending was excellent and the results unexpected  the acting by claire danes and kate beckinsale was very solid and well done  danes  who has been oversold and over hyped  actually arrived as an actor in this film  though her portrayal was frequently immature  as was her character   she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire  beckinsale  in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goody two shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison  hers was the best performance in the film  bill pullman was miscast as the lawyer  his wry and diffident style is an asset in films like  while you were sleeping   but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice  he had the wrong personality  the tourists look at thailand was interesting  but it didnt make me want to go there  overall  an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes  i gave it a 7 10 
Bad. Bad. Bad. Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesuque and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They'll try to chase Sam-I-Am and that mean guy who are running away with it. (I hope they don't ruin the classic book.)

"Infamous pre-code film, really the one film that caused people to insist on the Hayes Code being strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor-selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers. When he dies in an accident, she's released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants. She goes to New York and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although obviously there's no actual sex shown, the film is quite sleazy. Unfortunately, after the initial shock value fades (around the time Stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free), the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull. Stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through. As always, she's fantastic.",1,infamous pre code film  really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly enforced  barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers  when he dies in an accident  shes released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants  she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder  one bed at a time  although obviously theres no actual sex shown  the film is quite sleazy  unfortunately  after the initial shock value fades  around the time stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free   the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull  stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through  as always  shes fantastic 
"I've never been to Paris, but after seeing ""Paris, Je t'aime"" I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been to NY several times and I LOVE the city and its boroughs. I kinda expected to be touched by this film, to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away, but, lo and behold, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine. Maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city, where it's said to have thousands of people living on their own.

"I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it scared me witless for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to (obviously) the violence. My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie. I think they only say that knowing that I have such strong feelings about it ;0) I am currently reading the book (out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic) and it is really a great story. However I don't think that it should have been made into a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way. Gives me a little heart palpitation every time. Yah I am a wuss but I strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids, read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content.

"Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in ""The Unknown Man,"" a 1951 film also starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle, and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle) accused of murder and gets him acquitted. Shortly afterward, he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood. He is advised by the DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is small change, that to wipe out the organized crime, one has to find the top man. Mason finds the top man, and is faced with a dilemma.<br /><br />""The Unknown Man"" is a small, black and white film that manages to hold the viewer's interest with its various plot twists, though the plot is somewhat contrived. It's really the story of a good man seeking his god, justice, and what he is willing to do in order to attain it. And that's the most contrived part of all. I suppose there was a time before O.J., the Menendez Brothers, etc., etc., when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys. For this viewer anyway, those days are long over.<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job -- his handsome, elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful, confident man but also a deeply caring one. Pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom. He was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did. It may be because by the time he was getting leads, he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinée idol; or it could be he lacked that certain something; or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives an honest and touching performance here.<br /><br />Very good movie with good performances.",1,walter pidgeon is braley mason  a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in  the unknown man   a 1951 film also starring ann harding  barry sullivan  keefe braselle  and richard anderson  a great believer in justice  pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man  rudi walchek  braselle  accused of murder and gets him acquitted  shortly afterward  he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood  he is advised by the da  sullivan  that rudi is small change  that to wipe out the organized crime  one has to find the top man  mason finds the top man  and is faced with a dilemma   the unknown man  is a small  black and white film that manages to hold the viewers interest with its various plot twists  though the plot is somewhat contrived  its really the story of a good man seeking his god  justice  and what he is willing to do in order to attain it  and thats the most contrived part of all  i suppose there was a time before o j   the menendez brothers  etc   etc   when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys  for this viewer anyway  those days are long over  walter pidgeon does an excellent job    his handsome  elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful  confident man but also a deeply caring one  pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom  he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did  it may be because by the time he was getting leads  he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinée idol  or it could be he lacked that certain something  or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson  hard to say  he gives an honest and touching performance here  very good movie with good performances 
"Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live...but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. He plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed. Wanna know the only funny parts? The stuff they showed in the previews. Yes, his rendition of take on me is funny. Nothing else is. ESPECIALLY when you can tell he's trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he shouldn't have to try at because he is one. And yet, his 'demolishing the vet's office' bit comes off as cringingly bad. This movie made me develop an eye twitch.

The essentials are a bodyguard's search and destroy mission as his charge, young Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school, which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent. The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable, violent conclusion, with plot twists along the way. Washington, a former CIA operative with a drinking problem, gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot's outline. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning, the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends.

"Distortion is a disturbing, haunting film, about life imitating art and art reflecting life. Haim Bouzaglo, the director of the film, plays the role of Haim Bouzaglo, artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright, who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend's documentary. As an Arab suicide bomber, disguised in skullcap and American t-shirt, wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves, Haim transcribes his girl friend's life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors' lives during rehearsals. But the bomber has already struck and Haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier. Despite the manipulation of time and space, the story is crystal clear, comprehensive and absorbing, a brilliant commentary on the ""distortion"" of everyday Israeli life, where the political is intertwined with the personal, where everyone lives ""on the edge,"" and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone else's dramatic narrative.<br /><br />Bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else's production brilliantly. We are always voyeurs, seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the ""real"" director chooses to reveal. To remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy, Bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom (sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop), and repeatedly frames his views within TV, video, or security screens. Actors play the role of actors who represent the ""real"" characters played by actors. Of course, each of the actors is the star of his or her own production, only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor's personal films. The detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play. The actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for ""tips"" on how to play the role, is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes, and they attend a cast party as their real selves.<br /><br />Despite this multiplicity of views, there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative: the playwright searches for subject matter, the bomber seeks a target, and the detective stalks the filmmaker. Nor is there any difficulty locating Bouzaglo's ultimate targetenervated and impotent Israel, fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action. Israel is Bouzaglo, the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play. Israel is also the bankrupt soldier-entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker's documentary, the cheating actors and actresses, and the cuckolded husband. They are all Israel because they are all helpless, caught in inaction or aimless action, as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target. All the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep ""score"" of victims.<br /><br />There is personal triumph, vindication, perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film, but viewers will be left aching for the state of Israel even as they are filled with admiration for Bouzaglo's memorable rendition of a nation's plight within the telling of an individual's story.",1,distortion is a disturbing  haunting film  about life imitating art and art reflecting life  haim bouzaglo  the director of the film  plays the role of haim bouzaglo  artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright  who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friends documentary  as an arab suicide bomber  disguised in skullcap and american t shirt  wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves  haim transcribes his girl friends life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors lives during rehearsals  but the bomber has already struck and haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier  despite the manipulation of time and space  the story is crystal clear  comprehensive and absorbing  a brilliant commentary on the  distortion  of everyday israeli life  where the political is intertwined with the personal  where everyone lives  on the edge   and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone elses dramatic narrative  bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone elses production brilliantly  we are always voyeurs  seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the  real  director chooses to reveal  to remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy  bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom  sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop   and repeatedly frames his views within tv  video  or security screens  actors play the role of actors who represent the  real  characters played by actors  of course  each of the actors is the star of his or her own production  only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actors personal films  the detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play  the actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for  tips  on how to play the role  is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes  and they attend a cast party as their real selves  despite this multiplicity of views  there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative  the playwright searches for subject matter  the bomber seeks a target  and the detective stalks the filmmaker  nor is there any difficulty locating bouzaglos ultimate targetenervated and impotent israel  fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action  israel is bouzaglo  the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play  israel is also the bankrupt soldier entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmakers documentary  the cheating actors and actresses  and the cuckolded husband  they are all israel because they are all helpless  caught in inaction or aimless action  as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target  all the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep  score  of victims  there is personal triumph  vindication  perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film  but viewers will be left aching for the state of israel even as they are filled with admiration for bouzaglos memorable rendition of a nations plight within the telling of an individuals story 
"Ang Lee clearly likes to ease into a film, to catch action, characters and setting on the hoof, as they emerge. Covering the haphazard endgame of the American civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia, unformed in mind or manhood, this is an ideal approach. The film turns out to be about the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the mid-south as a silent character, enduring the strife like a hardy parent.<br /><br />James Schamus' script is probably the standard bearer for this film; close behind it are a number of well-appointed performances that carry it admirably. Jeffrey Wright's name alone could carry this film for me. He's brilliant here but in a slow burning role: instead we are treated to very good (if not revelatory) performances from a large, often recognisable ensemble.<br /><br />A noble, optimistic film. One to watch if you don't fancy the harder, more bittersweet Cold Mountain or The Claim, for example. 7/10",1,ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film  to catch action  characters and setting on the hoof  as they emerge  covering the haphazard endgame of the american civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia  unformed in mind or manhood  this is an ideal approach  the film turns out to be about the formation of personalities  adulthood and relationships  lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the mid south as a silent character  enduring the strife like a hardy parent  james schamus script is probably the standard bearer for this film  close behind it are a number of well appointed performances that carry it admirably  jeffrey wrights name alone could carry this film for me  hes brilliant here but in a slow burning role  instead we are treated to very good  if not revelatory  performances from a large  often recognisable ensemble  a noble  optimistic film  one to watch if you dont fancy the harder  more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim  for example  7 10

"""This Man's Navy"" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone. However, the first half of the movie is all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. The look is fairly gritty and realistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is really wild, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so leisurely. This is a blimp we're talking about. In the end, a feel-good WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.",1, this mans navy  is  as other comments have indicated  a rare and well filmed look at navy lighter than air  lta  activities  the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack  and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone  however  the first half of the movie is all about beery  his relationship with his service pals  and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother  and getting drakes leg fixed  only then does the second film start  the second film is mostly ltas in action  taking on a surfaced sub  guys get killed and much damage is caused  the look is fairly gritty and realistic  i imagine  then we shift to southeast asia  did the navy have ltas there  never mind  this part is really wild  with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle  and the japs are shooting like mad  shades of vietnam  except the getaway is oh  so leisurely  this is a blimp were talking about  in the end  a feel good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war

I know, racism is OK in these old films, but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility.

"This movie is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash. The film is rape/beating and revenge genre. Couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes. He didn't go to their car, instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped.Then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him... So stupid scenario! Bellow Hollywood ! He was against that revenge but ""She is raped"" ""They laugh to her"" so she must kill them all... But once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifle's top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy. Personally I think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang-rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money. LoL This movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they won't see anything they are looking for... This director should be banned...It is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by British cinematography which I personally like and that is the reason I've watched this. Don't do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film ...",0,this movie is the worst ive seen in the last 5 years  it is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash  the film is rape beating and revenge genre  couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes  he didnt go to their car  instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him    so stupid scenario  bellow hollywood   he was against that revenge but  she is raped   they laugh to her  so she must kill them all    but once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifles top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy  personally i think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money  lol this movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they wont see anything they are looking for    this director should be banned   it is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by british cinematography which i personally like and that is the reason ive watched this  dont do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film    
"There have been countless talking-animal films in the past, the majority of which either feature animals' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting, or are ridiculously amateur. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is neither.<br /><br />This film doesn't need the infant-pleasing addition of moving canine lips, or gesturing feline limbs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another, and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart (as all great boy-and-and-his-dog films should).<br /><br />Homeward Bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal romps to me, and boasts some beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from the genius of Bruce Broughton), and an impressive cast...<br /><br />Michael J. Fox ... Chance<br /><br />Sally Field ... Sassy<br /><br />Don Ameche ... Shadow<br /><br />Frank Welker (Voice God) ...

"My first exposure to the Templarios & not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video, which has brought us other cult classics such as ""Spider Baby"". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars (& set the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, ponderous &, ultimately, unfulfilling. Adding insult to injury: the movie was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.",0,my first exposure to the templarios   not a good one  i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video  which has brought us other cult classics such as  spider baby   the print quality is excellent  but this alone cant hide the fact that the film is deadly dull  theres a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars    set the whole thing in motion   but everything else in the movie is slow  ponderous    ultimately  unfulfilling  adding insult to injury  the movie was dubbed  not subtitled  as promised on the video jacket 
"I hand't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city ( New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in great style!<br /><br />She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! STanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.<br /><br />Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? <br /><br />This is pre-code Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect. This reminded me of ""Original Sin"" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like Baby FAce any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will love it.

"Remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid ""movie"" is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty, salted spoon. Perhaps ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" (1992) was a bit on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization I have ever heard of. A boy fighting off spies/terrorists when he's home alone in a Chicago suburb with the chickenpox? Ridiculous! Why did this film have to be made? I am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time, but rather learning experiences. However, this is actually a waste of time.

"The late 80's saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings. Renny Harlin's superbly gritty and moody ""Prison"" got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling; it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior ""The Chair,"" John Saxon's enjoyably trashy ""Death House,"" the passable psycho picture ""Destroyer,"" and this hideously limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium. <br /><br />Your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp Alex (the hugely unappealing Nicholas Celozzi) go to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up-and-coming rock star Sammy Mitchell (blandly played by Toni Basil of ""Hey Micky"" fame). Alex's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic US Civil War cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree, thus forcing wimpy Alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter.<br /><br />Although slickly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg, with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere (the film was shot on location in the dismal, rusty, rundown ruins of Alcatraz Island), ""Slaughterhouse rock"" nonetheless just doesn't cut it as a solid, effective fright feature. This is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters, a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing. The flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more, with onetime ""Playboy"" playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme Hope Marie Carlton doing an especially irritating Linnea Quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo. Dimitri Logothetis' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style, but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy, horrendously sophomoric silliness, and, most damagingly, Ted Landon's sloppy, inconsistent, overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far-fetched story even remotely plausible. In other words, this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn-out cinematic jail sentence.",0,the late 80s saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings  renny harlins superbly gritty and moody  prison  got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling  it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior  the chair   john saxons enjoyably trashy  death house   the passable psycho picture  destroyer   and this hideously limpnlethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium   your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp alex  the hugely unappealing nicholas celozzi  go to alcatraz island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up and coming rock star sammy mitchell  blandly played by toni basil of  hey micky  fame   alexs brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic us civil war cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree  thus forcing wimpy alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter  although slickly photographed by nicholas von sternberg  with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere  the film was shot on location in the dismal  rusty  rundown ruins of alcatraz island    slaughterhouse rock  nonetheless just doesnt cut it as a solid  effective fright feature  this is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters  a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing  the flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more  with onetime  playboy  playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme hope marie carlton doing an especially irritating linnea quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo  dimitri logothetis direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style  but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy  horrendously sophomoric silliness  and  most damagingly  ted landons sloppy  inconsistent  overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far fetched story even remotely plausible  in other words  this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn out cinematic jail sentence 
"The film portrays France's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in Western (Francophone) Africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman, France (herein symbolically representing her nation). It is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and a nation's desire to reach out to the 'other' it once 'owned' and moulded. This is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities.<br /><br />The characters all play a symbolic, albeit a limited and unconvincing role. France, meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a child-in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is just forgettable. The black Africans are, to say the least, offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material. They are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe-like France wonders seeking a world she never knew, and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon.",0,the film portrays frances unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in western  francophone  africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman  france  herein symbolically representing her nation   it is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young womans desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past  in particular  and a nations desire to reach out to the other it once owned and moulded  this is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling  or being in transit  from the present to the past  remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities  the characters all play a symbolic  albeit a limited and unconvincing role  france  meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary french society  leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a child in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality  the rest of the rag tag ensemble is just forgettable  the black africans are  to say the least  offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the directors poor handling of her material  they are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe like france wonders seeking a world she never knew  and hoping for one that can never be found in cameroon 
"First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal, and just downright depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on Christmas because her husband has lost his job, they are losing their house, can't buy Christmas presents for the kids, etc. You get the idea, happy stuff for the holidays. So along comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon the Christmas angel, who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them. What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee Nazis on the lam. The movie lays everything on so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this film wanted to be something Capra-like, but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be.",0,first of all  let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays  this movie is cold  brutal  and just downright depressing  mary steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on christmas because her husband has lost his job  they are losing their house  cant buy christmas presents for the kids  etc  you get the idea  happy stuff for the holidays  so along comes harry dean stanton as gideon the christmas angel  who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them  what better way to instill the spirit of christmas in mary steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in christmas again  santa claus is a blackmailer and his christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee nazis on the lam  the movie lays everything on so thick that you dont care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable  im sure this film wanted to be something capra like  but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be

Bill and Ted actually look cool in Bogus Journey, where as in Excellent Adventure they look rather like, well as they would put it, FAGS!!!<br /><br />Even the music in this movie is awsome, the score especially. There so much i could say about this film, cause i love it. But this is one of those movies i grew up watching and everytime i did i liked it more, so i can understand why people hate or just think its Bogus compared to Excellent adventure (which i also love by the way).<br /><br />GET DOWN WITH YOUR BAD SELF!!!!",1,i realize that alot of people hate this movie  but i must admit that it is one of my favorites  i happen to like it better then its predeccesor and happy to like it better than alot of movies  first off  i think that people never give the story any credit  much like back to the future  time travel is hard to write  and in this movie they included time travel and a spiritual journey  i also feel that keanu and alex were on there best performances in this movie  they looked cooler  acted cooler  and said cooler things  the set design of this movie is awsome as well  the sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage buds who can hardly spell   but isnt that the genius of the whole franchise  making these two idiots bigger than life characters that are responsible for the entire utopian future of earth  the costume design was awsome as well  bill and ted actually look cool in bogus journey  where as in excellent adventure they look rather like  well as they would put it  fags    even the music in this movie is awsome  the score especially  there so much i could say about this film  cause i love it  but this is one of those movies i grew up watching and everytime i did i liked it more  so i can understand why people hate or just think its bogus compared to excellent adventure  which i also love by the way   get down with your bad self    
"In the tradition of G-Men, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name, now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While it's 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, it would be showed in no other kind of light.<br /><br />The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it's founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out. It's important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it. Some of that time is covered in the film as well.<br /><br />But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John 'Chip' Hardesty was created. Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties.<br /><br />In real life the Bureau was headed by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency. It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in, he did just that. <br /><br />Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold. In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI's story itself. Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with, arresting Ku Klux Klan members, a plot to murder oil rich Indians, bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties, their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War.<br /><br />There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own. That involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today.<br /><br />Of course if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all American. Still the FBI does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one.<br /><br />The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films, but it's the first one I ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me. If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts, I'd feel a lot better about it. There's also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson.<br /><br />Vera Miles didn't just marry Stewart, she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates. It's dated mostly, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.",1,in the tradition of g men  the house on 92nd street  the street with no name  now comes the fbi story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light  while its 48 year director j  edgar hoover was alive  it would be showed in no other kind of light  the book by don whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from its founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out  its important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j  edgar hoover headed it  some of that time is covered in the film as well  but warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john chip hardesty was created  hardesty as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties  in real life the bureau was headed by william j  burns of the burns private detective agency  it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film  burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the harding administration  when hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in  he did just that   through the hardesty family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold  in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the fbis story itself  stewart and miles are most assuredly an all american couple  we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with  arresting ku klux klan members  a plot to murder oil rich indians  bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties  their involvement with apprehending nazi sympathizers in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold war  there is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own  that involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight  nick adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today  of course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american  still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one  the fbi story is not one of jimmy stewarts best films  but its the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me  if the whole fbi were made up jimmy stewarts  id feel a lot better about it  theres also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelson  vera miles didnt just marry stewart  she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates  its dated mostly  but still has a good and interesting story to tell 
"This begins a wager between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist...Poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle. Well, of course he can, but will he come out unscathed? Hard to say with all these strange people that aren't supposed to be there wandering around, including the icy Barbara Steele. This is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in French and English, and switches back and forth a few times. Perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost? It's also rather dark and claustrophobic, being that one doesn't see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate, plus there's a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times. This version (on Synapse) is also uncensored and I wondered what might be censored in a film from 1964 until I saw the topless scene, I guess that might be it. Overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white. Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie too. 8 out of 10.",1,this begins a wager between edgar allen poe and a journalist   poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle  well  of course he can  but will he come out unscathed  hard to say with all these strange people that arent supposed to be there wandering around  including the icy barbara steele  this is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in french and english  and switches back and forth a few times  perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost  its also rather dark and claustrophobic  being that one doesnt see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate  plus theres a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times  this version  on synapse  is also uncensored and i wondered what might be censored in a film from 1964 until i saw the topless scene  i guess that might be it  overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white  barbara steele definitely makes the movie too  8 out of 10

"This movie was not made by Who fans. Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over: In Christmas, they didn't show Daltry's screams after the line ""Tommy doesn't know what day it is..."", they showed almost *no* Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We're Not Gonna Take It (Listening to You), they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete's blazing guitar chords. Huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band. It's a very frustrating film to watch, and doesn't deliver the goods. I don't know if director Murry Lerner is just not a Who fan, or worse, for him at least, if he *is* a Who fan and this is all the *eight* cameras could deliver for him. To its credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some faves, that are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. This might be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you're not anticipating Tommy. The sound overall was mediocre in the transmission I watched from DirecTV; it may be different on video or DVD.",0,this movie was not made by who fans  most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half hour tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over  in christmas  they didnt show daltrys screams after the line  tommy doesnt know what day it is      they showed almost  no  townsend guitar shots in pinball wizard  there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of go to the mirror  and worst of all  in the second half of were not gonna take it  listening to you   they robbed us of almost every shot of petes blazing guitar chords  huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band  its a very frustrating film to watch  and doesnt deliver the goods  i dont know if director murry lerner is just not a who fan  or worse  for him at least  if he  is  a who fan and this is all the  eight  cameras could deliver for him  to its credit  there are some rare numbers before tommy  as well as some faves  that are very well shot  and sometimes the editing is brilliant  this might be enough to make some viewers happy  as long as youre not anticipating tommy  the sound overall was mediocre in the transmission i watched from directv  it may be different on video or dvd

These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.<br /><br />I found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the BORING section. This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.<br /><br />This film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.<br /><br />The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason.

"This foolish, implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard-boiled police detective delivers some nearly-audible lines confirming our greatest fears: He is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That a no-name hack-tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is brief; his promise is immense. Perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill-advised film.",0,this foolish  implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard boiled police detective delivers some nearly audible lines confirming our greatest fears  he is dead  perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of a  martinez in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment  that a no name hack tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver  his moment is brief  his promise is immense  perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill advised film

Not only are the song lyrics retarded, they sing badly. Okay, I'm kinda getting off the movie here.....anyways, it was boring and they acted horribly. It was NOT funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be. I guess they deserve some credit for that...well, the movie isn't worth your time. Just look at its rating. The movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act, not babbling their lines in a monotone. I am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually BETTER than those Nat and Alex guys. Hurry before it's too late!

"I can always tell when something is going to be a hit. I see it or hear it, and get a good feeling. I did not get a good feeling watching the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this film, and I am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films. I was in fact proved right.<br /><br />The first thing that threw me off was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics(I am black by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title, and for this time use a title that doesn't have bad grammar. I heard the dialog, saw the acting and all I could do was make faces.<br /><br />I also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone.

"Scooby Doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple, successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world. So, what happens when you've been everywhere and done everything with the formula? You switch it up right? Wrong. You stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again, keeping the core of its success intact. That is to say, stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it. This to me is why ""What's New Scooby Doo"" worked, they want back to the classic Scooby Doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" but for the most part had not been tapped since the original ""Scooby Doo Where Are You"".<br /><br />The first sign (to me) of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters; there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think ""Scooby Doo"" you aren't thinking of Film-Flam, Scrappy Doo or Scooby Dum. Even worse, the exclusion of the other core members of ""Mystery Inc"" generally indicate a group of production people who don't understand from a kids point of view how the show works. The basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual, stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand.<br /><br />This next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want: I hope that I can explain why I think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole; Fred represents the Driver, I think in general it is the purpose of Fred to give the group direction, organization and sub-tasks. Fred isn't a happy-go-lucky teenager, he's your boss, your teacher, your dad, your authority figure. Fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks (problem always equals solution for Fred). In many ways Fred is the antithesis to Shaggy. Shaggy is your best friend, that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are, he enables you to be brave, to not be at the back of the pack. Shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear. Velma represents rational thought, she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show. Left on her own would Velma solve a mystery? The group often finds itself in situations where truths aren't obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task, chance is represented by Daphne. At one point (I think it is the first Scooby Doo series) she was known as ""danger prone"". Writers have used Daphne to link unrelated events together through accident. She frequently is the one who finds the secret door, collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together. Finally Scooby himself represents us, the participant. He is always in the centre of events, capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of, yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate. Scooby Doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining.<br /><br />Maybe I'm over thinking things but, in my life I've seen a lot of Scooby Doo (being a 30 year old self-proclaimed nerd, it kind of rolls with the territory). To me there is a magic with the classic ""Scooby Doo"" formula that should never be messed with.<br /><br />As many have pointed out; Scooby Doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite, it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal. Messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else, something lesser.",0,scooby doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple  successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world  so  what happens when youve been everywhere and done everything with the formula  you switch it up right  wrong  you stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again  keeping the core of its success intact  that is to say  stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it  this to me is why  whats new scooby doo  worked  they want back to the classic scooby doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in  a pup named scooby doo  but for the most part had not been tapped since the original  scooby doo where are you   the first sign  to me  of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters  there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think  scooby doo  you arent thinking of film flam  scrappy doo or scooby dum  even worse  the exclusion of the other core members of  mystery inc  generally indicate a group of production people who dont understand from a kids point of view how the show works  the basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual  stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand  this next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want  i hope that i can explain why i think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole  fred represents the driver  i think in general it is the purpose of fred to give the group direction  organization and sub tasks  fred isnt a happy go lucky teenager  hes your boss  your teacher  your dad  your authority figure  fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks  problem always equals solution for fred   in many ways fred is the antithesis to shaggy  shaggy is your best friend  that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are  he enables you to be brave  to not be at the back of the pack  shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear  velma represents rational thought  she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show  left on her own would velma solve a mystery  the group often finds itself in situations where truths arent obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task  chance is represented by daphne  at one point  i think it is the first scooby doo series  she was known as  danger prone   writers have used daphne to link unrelated events together through accident  she frequently is the one who finds the secret door  collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together  finally scooby himself represents us  the participant  he is always in the centre of events  capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of  yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate  scooby doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining  maybe im over thinking things but  in my life ive seen a lot of scooby doo  being a 30 year old self proclaimed nerd  it kind of rolls with the territory   to me there is a magic with the classic  scooby doo  formula that should never be messed with  as many have pointed out  scooby doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite  it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal  messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else  something lesser

"Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson, and Binnie Barnes star in ""The Divorce of Lady X,"" a 1938 comedy based on a play. Olivier plays a young barrister, Everard Logan who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the London fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home. The next day, a friend of his, Lord Mere (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel, and he wants to divorce her. Believing the woman to be Oberon, Olivier panics. Oberon, who is single and the granddaughter of a judge, pretends that she's the lady in question, Lady Mere, when she's really Leslie Steele.<br /><br />We've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time. With this cast, it's delightful. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, that great team in Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight, nervous barrister. Oberon gives her role the right light touch. She looks extremely young here, fuller in the face, with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her. She wears some beautiful street clothes, though her first gown looks like a birthday cake, and in one gown she tries on, with that hair-do, she's ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is delightful as the real Lady Mere.<br /><br />The color in this is a mess, and as others have mentioned, it could really use a restoration.

I'm Italian, I cannot go proud of my country for many reasons, but I wouldn't have rowed for another team (The French, for example), simply because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. Besides the protagonist doesn't fall in love desire with a British girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman, so why rowing against Yale.

The show is as wacky as they come and I'm sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes. But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show. <br /><br />In the world of Yakitate! it is not uncommon for people to look like they've just had an orgasm after eating bread.

"Dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography, Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era.

"What is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is, in fact, a head-ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters (the only big actor being Ginger Rogers, in a very early role) all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building. These characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean. As a cheap, low budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and her lead man (some guy, I don't care who he is 'cause he really sucked) talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime, while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt. Honestly, I've never had a worse time watching an old b-rate movie of this type, and I've seen some real head-slappers.<br /><br />Oh, and the butler didn't do it, because there wasn't a butler.

"Kim (Patricia Clarkson), George (Jake Weber) and son Miles (Erik Per Sullivan) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan's bustling metropolis. On the way, they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow. A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along. Rather than helping, at least one of the hunters, Otis (John Speredakos), is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers. George, Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis, and even worse, we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they're staying. Meanwhile, Miles is given a wendigo (a kind of Indian shape-shifting spirit/monster) token by an Indian whom only he has seen. Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes? Are there wendigos in the woods? <br /><br />I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers. It is a fairly low budget film, with technical limitations frequently showing through. Much of the film, and maybe all of it, is not really about the titular creature. And perhaps the fatal blow for many people, it has a very ambiguous ending, with a number of questions left unanswered. If you are discouraged by such endings, and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant, do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.<br /><br />Personally, I like films like that. I usually prefer some ambiguity. The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick, scary creature flick, where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end, and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2: The Monster Returns, but that's not what this film is. Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people. Heck, writer/director Larry Fessenden even has a character, George, reciting Robert Frost. The Frost poem, and George's comment that Frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things, is the key to the film.<br /><br />One of the best things about the film is its complexity. In a way, there are four different films occurring at the same time, a thread from each character. In George's thread, he isn't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world, and he has some parenting problems. For him, the film is a realistic, horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse. In Patricia's thread, she's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family. She's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her, hoping that they'll go away and get better. In Otis' thread, he's even more down on his luck than George, and George's arrival into his life symbolizes the final ""crack"" in his psychological armor. And in Miles' thread, which is probably the most important of the film, life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world. But this is a horror story, after all, albeit one with a glimmer of hope, and the events in the film give Miles' poetic interpretations a dark turn. Still, when everything is said and done, he seems to be the only one retaining his composure, due to the poetic outlook.<br /><br />Even though the film is low budget, there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambitions. Fessenden and director of photography Terry Stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations, and created some interesting slide show like montages (such as the cards, or the Indian wendigo images from the book). There are also interesting more traditional montages, such as Miles' nightmare. Wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.<br /><br />Other technical aspects are good for the budget. The ""Wendigo"" appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous. The lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been, but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock (it could have been digital instead) or transfer. I thought the performances were good and far more realistic (if you value that) than the majority of films. Although I didn't really notice the score, it must have been okay, or I would have noticed it with a negative judgment.<br /><br />Overall, Wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions, as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch.",1,kim  patricia clarkson   george  jake weber  and son miles  erik per sullivan  are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattans bustling metropolis  on the way  they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow  a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along  rather than helping  at least one of the hunters  otis  john speredakos   is mad because the accident cracked the bucks antlers  george  kim and miles are disturbed by otis  and even worse  we quickly learn that otis has learned where theyre staying  meanwhile  miles is given a wendigo  a kind of indian shape shifting spirit monster  token by an indian whom only he has seen  is otis a psycho out to get our heroes  are there wendigos in the woods   i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers  it is a fairly low budget film  with technical limitations frequently showing through  much of the film  and maybe all of it  is not really about the titular creature  and perhaps the fatal blow for many people  it has a very ambiguous ending  with a number of questions left unanswered  if you are discouraged by such endings  and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant  do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo  personally  i like films like that  i usually prefer some ambiguity  the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick  scary creature flick  where theyd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end  and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2  the monster returns  but thats not what this film is  wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people  heck  writer director larry fessenden even has a character  george  reciting robert frost  the frost poem  and georges comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things  is the key to the film  one of the best things about the film is its complexity  in a way  there are four different films occurring at the same time  a thread from each character  in georges thread  he isnt exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world  and he has some parenting problems  for him  the film is a realistic  horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse  in patricias thread  shes looking for rejuvenation of her life and family  shes a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her  hoping that theyll go away and get better  in otis thread  hes even more down on his luck than george  and georges arrival into his life symbolizes the final  crack  in his psychological armor  and in miles thread  which is probably the most important of the film  life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world  but this is a horror story  after all  albeit one with a glimmer of hope  and the events in the film give miles poetic interpretations a dark turn  still  when everything is said and done  he seems to be the only one retaining his composure  due to the poetic outlook  even though the film is low budget  there are a lot of well executed higher budget ambitions  fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations  and created some interesting slide show like montages  such as the cards  or the indian wendigo images from the book   there are also interesting more traditional montages  such as miles nightmare  wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films  other technical aspects are good for the budget  the  wendigo  appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous  the lighting was usually good  there were a few times that dark scenes werent as clear as they could have been  but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock  it could have been digital instead  or transfer  i thought the performances were good and far more realistic  if you value that  than the majority of films  although i didnt really notice the score  it must have been okay  or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment  overall  wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions  as long as you dont mind having to think about the movies you watch 
"Having just watched this film again from a 1998 showing off VH-1, I just had to comment.<br /><br />The first time I saw this film on TV, it was about 1981, and I remember taping it off of my mother's betamax. It wound up taping in black and white for some reason, which gave it a period look that I grew to like.<br /><br />I remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song, ""My Bonnie"", as the camera panned over a scene of Liverpool. I also remember the opening scene where Paul gestures to some girls and says, ""Look, talent!"" So it was with great irritation that I popped in my 1998 taped version and ""remembered"" that the film opens with ""She Loves You"", instead of ""My Bonnie"". When you see how slowly the camera pans vs. the speed of the music, you can see that ""She Loves You"" just doesn't fit. Also, in this ""later"" version when Paul sees the girls, he says, ""Look, GIRLS!""..and somehow having remembered the earlier version, THAT word just didn't seem to fit, either. Why they felt they had to Americanize this film for American audiences is beyond me. Personally, if I'm going to watch a film about a British band, I want all of the British colloquialisms and such that would be a part of their speech, mannerisms, etc.<br /><br />Another irritation was how ""choppy"" the editing was for television. Just after Stu gets beaten, for example, the film cuts to a commercial break-LOTS of 'em. Yeah, I know it depends on the network, but it really ruins the effect of a film to have it sliced apart, as we all know. What some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue (and thereby okay to edit), may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows.<br /><br />My point is, the ""best"" version of this film was probably the earlier version I taped from 1981, which just so happened to include the ""Shake, Rattle & Roll"" scene that my 1998 version didn't. I started to surmise that there had to have been two different versions made for television, and a look at the ""alternate versions"" link regarding this film proved me right. That the American version had some shorter/cut/different scenes and/or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things. Imo, ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the European version of this film, if possible, and (probably even less possible), an unedited version. Sadly, I had to discard my old betamax European version because I didn't know how to convert it.<br /><br />All that aside, I found this film to be, perhaps, one of the best films regarding the story behind the ""birth of the Beatles"". Being well aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and TV when portraying events in history, I didn't let any discrepancies mar my enjoyment of the film. Sure, you see the Beatles perform songs at the Cavern that made me wonder, ""Did they even write that back then?? I don't think so"", but, nevertheless, I thought it was a great film and the performances, wonderful.<br /><br />The real stand-out for me, in fact, was the actor who played John, Stephen MacKenna. I just about fell in love with him. His look, mannerisms, personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot-on. He looked enough like a young John for me to do a double-take towards the end of the film when you see the Beatles performing on Ed Sullivan for the first time. I actually found myself questioning whether or not it was actual Beatle footage, until I saw the other actors in the scene.<br /><br />If you're looking for a dead accurate history of The Beatles' life and beginnings, you can't get any better than, ""The Beatles' Anthology"", as it was ""written"" by the boys', themselves. However, if you're looking for a fun snapshot of their pre-Beatlemania days leading up to their arrival in America and you leave your anal critical assessments at the door, you can't go wrong with the ""Birth of the Beatles""--a MUST for any ""real"" or casual Beatle fan.",1,having just watched this film again from a 1998 showing off vh 1  i just had to comment  the first time i saw this film on tv  it was about 1981  and i remember taping it off of my mothers betamax  it wound up taping in black and white for some reason  which gave it a period look that i grew to like  i remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song   my bonnie   as the camera panned over a scene of liverpool  i also remember the opening scene where paul gestures to some girls and says   look  talent   so it was with great irritation that i popped in my 1998 taped version and  remembered  that the film opens with  she loves you   instead of  my bonnie   when you see how slowly the camera pans vs  the speed of the music  you can see that  she loves you  just doesnt fit  also  in this  later  version when paul sees the girls  he says   look  girls    and somehow having remembered the earlier version  that word just didnt seem to fit  either  why they felt they had to americanize this film for american audiences is beyond me  personally  if im going to watch a film about a british band  i want all of the british colloquialisms and such that would be a part of their speech  mannerisms  etc  another irritation was how  choppy  the editing was for television  just after stu gets beaten  for example  the film cuts to a commercial break lots of em  yeah  i know it depends on the network  but it really ruins the effect of a film to have it sliced apart  as we all know  what some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue  and thereby okay to edit   may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows  my point is  the  best  version of this film was probably the earlier version i taped from 1981  which just so happened to include the  shake  rattle   roll  scene that my 1998 version didnt  i started to surmise that there had to have been two different versions made for television  and a look at the  alternate versions  link regarding this film proved me right  that the american version had some shorter cut different scenes and or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things  imo  ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the european version of this film  if possible  and  probably even less possible   an unedited version  sadly  i had to discard my old betamax european version because i didnt know how to convert it  all that aside  i found this film to be  perhaps  one of the best films regarding the story behind the  birth of the beatles   being well aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and tv when portraying events in history  i didnt let any discrepancies mar my enjoyment of the film  sure  you see the beatles perform songs at the cavern that made me wonder   did they even write that back then   i dont think so   but  nevertheless  i thought it was a great film and the performances  wonderful  the real stand out for me  in fact  was the actor who played john  stephen mackenna  i just about fell in love with him  his look  mannerisms  personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot on  he looked enough like a young john for me to do a double take towards the end of the film when you see the beatles performing on ed sullivan for the first time  i actually found myself questioning whether or not it was actual beatle footage  until i saw the other actors in the scene  if youre looking for a dead accurate history of the beatles life and beginnings  you cant get any better than   the beatles anthology   as it was  written  by the boys  themselves  however  if youre looking for a fun snapshot of their pre beatlemania days leading up to their arrival in america and you leave your anal critical assessments at the door  you cant go wrong with the  birth of the beatles   a must for any  real  or casual beatle fan 
I chose to watch this film at Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival. Both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first-time production.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and New York City (Brooklyn in specific). The movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life  again kudos to the director on this fine choice.<br /><br />This is gem and I would whole heartedly recommend it (I'm sure it will make it to the screen).,1,i chose to watch this film at tribeca based on judd hirsch and scott cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival  both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level  the director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first time production  one interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and new york city  brooklyn in specific   the movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary brooklyn life  again kudos to the director on this fine choice  this is gem and i would whole heartedly recommend it  im sure it will make it to the screen  
"EA have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world. The graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional.

"A young cat tries to steal back his brothers soul from death but only gets half of it and then has to go adventuring to get the other half... or maybe not. <br /><br />Frankly I'm not sure what happens in this film which is full of very strange, very surreal images some of which parents might find disturbing, (ie.the cats slicing off part of a pig who is traveling with them and the frying it like bacon which all three eat).<br /><br />This is a very strange film that some have likened to Hello Kitty on acid, I think its more like Hello Kitty as done by Dali.

"Deep Shock plays out like a TV movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a poorly designed creature to be the ""bad guy,"" and a script that is more full of technical, political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with.<br /><br />I checked out the movie because of the creature (I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos), and right off the bat, I got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. The actors I expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point). The music was typical, not-thought-out action symphonic music.<br /><br />I liked the design of the computers and technical equipment, along with the mini-sub design. The movie even flowed really well, with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in. But there isn't much of a story here anyways.<br /><br />This movie gets a 3/10 stars IMO. The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame. Even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming. Chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the bench and into a video.

"I never understood why some people dislike Bollywood films: they've got charismatic actors, great dance numbers, and heightened emotion--what's not to like? What I didn't realize was that I had only seen the upper-crust of Bollywood. Then I watched ""Garam Masala"". I could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie I was going to like (the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models), but I kept hoping things would improve. Sadly, they didn't. The main problem is that the two protagonists, Mac & Sam, are completely unsympathetic. They spend the entire movie lying to women--and lying brutally- -in order to get them into bed, and the audience is supposed to find this funny, and be charmed. The boys are unscrupulous and inept, and not in a lovable way. Mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating. The script is extremely poor, with repetitive scenes, setups that never lead to anything, and illogical actions and statements by the characters. In fact, the characters are never really developed at all. The males are boorish, greedy jerks, and the women merely interchangeably beautiful. If you go by this movie, you would think that ""air hostesses"" are pretty easy to pass from man to man. In reality, betrayal is not so humorous. <br /><br />The only bright spots I found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets, and a few slapsticky moments involving the French-farce, door-slamming aspects of the story. But Bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by Farah Khan, and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, who seem to have influenced writer/director Priyadarshan not a little. Priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story: the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play ""Boeing Boeing."" The original author of that work, Marc Camoletti, is credited nowhere. At least Priyadarshan changed the title for this remake, rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit, as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale.

"This TV-made thriller is all talk, little action. It works hard to set up its convoluted plot, yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best. By the end, I knew no more about these characters than I did at the beginning. It has a quasi-""Ten Little Indians"" scenario, but ditches it mid-way through in favor of spotlighting Sally Field and her uncovering of a killer. Field overacts here with a gracelessness I've seldom seen from her. The early introductions are good, but the writing quickly strays off-course and eventually goes over the top. Lots of hysteria, and constant thunder and lightning effects (which adds nothing). A curious failure from producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg.

Great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time, but that you can find happiness with ""fire and passion"" as the main character Gigi would say.",1,this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just great  it isnt an idealistic movie  i would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place  the characters are very nice but have also some  dark  sides  what makes you believe that these are real persons  great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time  but that you can find happiness with  fire and passion  as the main character gigi would say 
"I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic. That is the only positive thing I can say about this truly horrid adaptation.<br /><br />Have you read 'Wise Blood?' It's an amazing book. Flannery O'Connor wrote about the south as no one else has. She was a southerner herself, a devout catholic, and a remarkably gifted writer. In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith, doubt, and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness. The characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south, but I can assure you that such people do exist. Not only do they exist, they are human beings with families, feelings, and concerns like anyone else. Flannery's intentions were so often misunderstood - she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots - she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called 'grace'...even in the most violent, distressing, and maddening of circumstances. To read 'Wise Blood' is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom. Finally, it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions - our entire world view.<br /><br />None of this comes through in John Huston's 'Gilligan's Island'-like adaptation. None. It is a farce. A bad farce. The entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach. The acting is poor, the southern accents are fake and insulting. The filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners. Ms. O'Connor's intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap, amateur theatre. The soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and 'Clockwork Orange'-style cheeseball electronics that doesn't fit the story or even the MOVIE. I was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out. Truly, truly terrible.<br /><br />As an aside, I do not agree with Ms. O'Connor's religious views, and while I was raised in the deep south, years ago I made my way north and have not looked back. But the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals (like every other place on earth), and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive. If you're into being offended (which I am not), then this movie most DEFINITELY crosses the line.<br /><br />I don't like to talk crap about an artist's work - John Huston was a man that I did not know, and I'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker, to which his respected place in film history attests. My views are clearly skewed by having read (and loved) Flannery O'Connor's work. So I don't claim to be coming from any other perspective. Maybe as a stand-alone film it works for cinephiles. But for Flannery O'Connor fans - and, I might add, for self-respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes - this movie is a waste of time.",0,i realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic  that is the only positive thing i can say about this truly horrid adaptation  have you read wise blood  its an amazing book  flannery oconnor wrote about the south as no one else has  she was a southerner herself  a devout catholic  and a remarkably gifted writer  in her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith  doubt  and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness  the characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south  but i can assure you that such people do exist  not only do they exist  they are human beings with families  feelings  and concerns like anyone else  flannerys intentions were so often misunderstood   she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots   she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called grace   even in the most violent  distressing  and maddening of circumstances  to read wise blood is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom  finally  it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions   our entire world view  none of this comes through in john hustons gilligans island like adaptation  none  it is a farce  a bad farce  the entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach  the acting is poor  the southern accents are fake and insulting  the filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners  ms  oconnors intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap  amateur theatre  the soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and clockwork orange style cheeseball electronics that doesnt fit the story or even the movie  i was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out  truly  truly terrible  as an aside  i do not agree with ms  oconnors religious views  and while i was raised in the deep south  years ago i made my way north and have not looked back  but the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals  like every other place on earth   and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive  if youre into being offended  which i am not   then this movie most definitely crosses the line  i dont like to talk crap about an artists work   john huston was a man that i did not know  and im sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker  to which his respected place in film history attests  my views are clearly skewed by having read  and loved  flannery oconnors work  so i dont claim to be coming from any other perspective  maybe as a stand alone film it works for cinephiles  but for flannery oconnor fans   and  i might add  for self respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes   this movie is a waste of time 
"Was'nt really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. But the ending was really really shocking to everyone in attendance & the ones who were watching at home.<br /><br />FIRST MATCH- RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W/ LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad opener, these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match. Flair wins by DQ after Edge slams him with his MITB briefcase. 3/10 SECOND MATCH- TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these Divas faced off in the ring together. Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick, but Trish ducks & nails her own Chick Kick for the win to retain her title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH- TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW Seriously good this match was, really. The whole match HHH focuses on Big Show's injured arm but Big Show still fights back. Later HHH is able to topple down Big Show & nails a Pedigree for the win. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN W/ MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a bonus match} Not that bad, it was alright. After Viscera was down, behind the referee, Benjamin's mama got a purse {Which had bricks in it} & slammed Viscera on the head with it three times. Viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by Benjamin for the win against the big man. 4/10<br /><br />FIFTH MATCH- JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow & sloppy. Both men didn't really put a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for the win. 2/10<br /><br />SIXTH MATCH- TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST EVER WOMEN'S GAUNTLET MATCH It was pretty entertaining to me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice last to win the first ever Women's Gauntlet match. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W/ DAIVARI IN AN ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool Elimination chamber match. But nothing will top last year's Elimination Chamber which was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters & gets a roll-up on him to eliminate him. Seconds later Cena gets a roll-up on Carlito for the three count to win the Elimination Chamber & retain his WWE Title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out & congratulates Cena for his victory. Vince McMahon states that his night is not over yet, & says that Edge cashes in his Money In The Bank opportunity to challenge Cena for the title. Edge comes out with Lita, gives the briefcase to Vince & heads off in the ring as Cena has one more match to go here tonight.<br /><br />EIGHT MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W/ LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena who is busted open during the Chamber match} gets pounded straight away by Edge, Edge then nails a Spear on Cena, goes for the cover & to his shock Cena breaks out. Edge nails another Spear & covers for the shocking three count as he has beat Cena & has won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Years Revolution was better than this year's, but it was still alright. The EC match was also good & the shocking of Edge cashing in his MITB opportunity is definitely the most shockingest on the PPV show.<br /><br />Overall: I'll give it 7/10 & a C",1,wasnt really bad for raws first ppv of 006  but the ending was really really shocking to everyone in attendance   the ones who were watching at home  first match  ric flair vs  edge w  lita for the wwe intercontinental championship not a bad opener  these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match  flair wins by dq after edge slams him with his mitb briefcase  3 10 second match  trish stratus vs  mickie james for the wwe womens championship not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these divas faced off in the ring together  mickie goes for a modified chick kick  but trish ducks   nails her own chick kick for the win to retain her title  3 10 third match  triple h vs  big show seriously good this match was  really  the whole match hhh focuses on big shows injured arm but big show still fights back  later hhh is able to topple down big show   nails a pedigree for the win  5 10 fourth match  shelton benjamin w  mama vs  viscera  this was a bonus match  not that bad  it was alright  after viscera was down  behind the referee  benjamins mama got a purse  which had bricks in it    slammed viscera on the head with it three times  viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by benjamin for the win against the big man  4 10 fifth match  jerry the king lawler vs  gregory helms boring  slow   sloppy  both men didnt really put a very good effort  jerry lawler wins after a fist drop for the win  2 10 sixth match  torrie wilson vs  victoria vs  ashley vs  maria vs  candice michelle in a first ever womens gauntlet match it was pretty entertaining to me  ashley  i think  eliminates candice last to win the first ever womens gauntlet match  5 10 seventh match  john cena vs  chris masters vs  carlito vs  shawn michaels vs  kane vs  kurt angle w  daivari in an elimination chamber match for the wwe championship it was a cool elimination chamber match  but nothing will top last years elimination chamber which was the best  the last three are masters  cena   carlito  carlito turns his back on masters   gets a roll up on him to eliminate him  seconds later cena gets a roll up on carlito for the three count to win the elimination chamber   retain his wwe title  but his night was not over yet  7 10 after the match  vince mcmahon comes out   congratulates cena for his victory  vince mcmahon states that his night is not over yet    says that edge cashes in his money in the bank opportunity to challenge cena for the title  edge comes out with lita  gives the briefcase to vince   heads off in the ring as cena has one more match to go here tonight  eight match  john cena vs  edge w  lita for the wwe championship  cena who is busted open during the chamber match  gets pounded straight away by edge  edge then nails a spear on cena  goes for the cover   to his shock cena breaks out  edge nails another spear   covers for the shocking three count as he has beat cena   has won the wwe championship for the first time in his career  1 10 so last years new years revolution was better than this years  but it was still alright  the ec match was also good   the shocking of edge cashing in his mitb opportunity is definitely the most shockingest on the ppv show  overall  ill give it 7 10   a c
"Thanks Jymn Magon, for creating Disney's 2 best cartoons ever. This show has improved very much over the years. As a kid, I didn't like it because I thought it was a rip-off of Ducktales, which was my favorite Disney thing at the time (like Grandmoffromero). Then later on though it was good but not great. But after reading the reviews here, I decided to give it another chance & bought the DVD set & watched the whole pilot the first day I got it, & was very pleasantly surprised. It's still my favorite episode, although the series did live up to it. And by the end of disc 1, I knew this was going to be a top tenner.<br /><br />The characters are so complex & charming. My favorite has got to be Wildcat. He's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot. My next favorite is Baloo, the best pilot on the show. I can see why 'ol Jymn built the show around him. Then it's Kit Cloudkicker. He & Baloo have the best relationship in the series. After that, Louie. Jim Cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice. After him, Rebecca. She has made me laugh pretty hard, and I do believe she and Baloo eventually marry. And finally(for the heroes), Molly. Although she's my least favorite, I still like her. I think she's a very cute character(much better than Webby from Ducktales). And the villains were very original. Don Karnage & his air pirates always crack me up, Kahn is ice-cold and ruthless, and the Thembrians are always at least amusing.<br /><br />As said before, the stories range from hilarious(Time Waits For No Bear, Romance of Red Chimp) to nothing short of touching(The Old Man & the Seaduck, Paradise Lost), to fun, funny & exciting adventures(In Search of Ancient Blunders & my favorite For Whom the Bell Klangs). These are only a few of my favorite episodes. Anyway, Talespin is Disney's best, aside from Gummi Bears Some reasons for this? GB had a decent amount of my favorite character(Cubbi), while TS didn't have enough of Wildcat. But in the end Talespin remains a classic. BOTTOM LINE- 10/10 6th best cartoon ever.",1,thanks jymn magon  for creating disneys 2 best cartoons ever  this show has improved very much over the years  as a kid  i didnt like it because i thought it was a rip off of ducktales  which was my favorite disney thing at the time  like grandmoffromero   then later on though it was good but not great  but after reading the reviews here  i decided to give it another chance   bought the dvd set   watched the whole pilot the first day i got it    was very pleasantly surprised  its still my favorite episode  although the series did live up to it  and by the end of disc 1  i knew this was going to be a top tenner  the characters are so complex   charming  my favorite has got to be wildcat  hes absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot  my next favorite is baloo  the best pilot on the show  i can see why ol jymn built the show around him  then its kit cloudkicker  he   baloo have the best relationship in the series  after that  louie  jim cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice  after him  rebecca  she has made me laugh pretty hard  and i do believe she and baloo eventually marry  and finally for the heroes   molly  although shes my least favorite  i still like her  i think shes a very cute character much better than webby from ducktales   and the villains were very original  don karnage   his air pirates always crack me up  kahn is ice cold and ruthless  and the thembrians are always at least amusing  as said before  the stories range from hilarious time waits for no bear  romance of red chimp  to nothing short of touching the old man   the seaduck  paradise lost   to fun  funny   exciting adventures in search of ancient blunders   my favorite for whom the bell klangs   these are only a few of my favorite episodes  anyway  talespin is disneys best  aside from gummi bears some reasons for this  gb had a decent amount of my favorite character cubbi   while ts didnt have enough of wildcat  but in the end talespin remains a classic  bottom line  10 10 6th best cartoon ever 
"Ok, needless to say, this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience; namely stoners and like-minded people.<br /><br />That being said, if you are one of these aformentioned people, this film is a MUST. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong. What Monty Python's Holy Grail is to geeks and nerds, so is this movie to potheads. I first saw this film 10 years ago or so, and I still crack up every time I watch it. The jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle, far better than latter day knockoffs like Half-Baked attempt to.<br /><br />There isn't a plot, so to speak; the film is more of a collection of various skits; as the films protagonists wander around Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Despite this, the film has an excellent sense of pace, and doesn't drag at all. Many people cite Up In Smoke as C&C's best work, but I would have to say that Next Movie is superior.<br /><br />So if you're in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs, light up, tune in, and let your mind float away =)<br /><br />Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!",1,ok  needless to say  this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience  namely stoners and like minded people  that being said  if you are one of these aformentioned people  this film is a must  in fact  i think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong  what monty pythons holy grail is to geeks and nerds  so is this movie to potheads  i first saw this film 10 years ago or so  and i still crack up every time i watch it  the jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle  far better than latter day knockoffs like half baked attempt to  there isnt a plot  so to speak  the film is more of a collection of various skits  as the films protagonists wander around los angeles in their legendary haze  despite this  the film has an excellent sense of pace  and doesnt drag at all  many people cite up in smoke as c cs best work  but i would have to say that next movie is superior  so if youre in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs  light up  tune in  and let your mind float away    oh  and free tommy chong

"Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers. Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for; but to be effective they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round. The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwell's ""1984"" (first published in 1948), and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film.<br /><br />Watch or read it: and then, when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man, reach for Cinderella 2000. This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period. Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption. There are many worse films appearing as DVD's these days, and frankly I do not care much what happens either way.<br /><br />So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been ""The Handmaiden's Tale"", but I would very happily swap them all for a well made film of Jack London's towering novel ""The Iron Heel"". Ambitious as this would be, it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it (IMDb only lists a B/W silent version made in Russia in 1919).",0,life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers  such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for  but to be effective they must also be entertaining  unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read  whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round  the first such work to become really widely known was probably george orwells  1984   first published in 1948   and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film  watch or read it  and then  when you are feeling a little depressed by mans inhumanity to man  reach for cinderella 2000  this is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing  and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period  most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments  to exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a dvd or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption  there are many worse films appearing as dvds these days  and frankly i do not care much what happens either way  so far the best of the films of this genre has probably been  the handmaidens tale   but i would very happily swap them all for a well made film of jack londons towering novel  the iron heel   ambitious as this would be  it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it  imdb only lists a b w silent version made in russia in 1919

"This is almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.",0,this is almost certainly the worst western ive ever seen  the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films    hero learns that family friends have been murdered  so hero sets out to exact revenge  foils the ineffective lawman  rescues the kidnapped loving damsel  and murders the expert arch nemesis in a brutal duel  this formula has often been successful    otherwise it wouldnt be a formula    but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it youll ever see  the scripting is atrociously simple minded and insulting  it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth  maturity  and realism  the sound is bad  it sometimes looks dubbed  the cinematography is lame  and the sets are sometimes just facades  the acting is pitiful  sure  some of the performers could blame the script  but others cannot use that excuse  i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again  every time he says a line that should be angry or mean  he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho  and speaking of chris lybbert  who plays hopalong  check out his duds  if you dare to watch this film   he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard working  down and dirty cowboy  if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy  then get this  but if you have more than two neurons  watch something else 
"Have you ever heard the saying that people ""telegraph their intentions?"" Well in this movie, the characters' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head. This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. Embeth Davidtz's character is not mysterious, just wooden, and Kenneth Branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have.<br /><br />The bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque ""Southern"" accents employed by British actors.",0,have you ever heard the saying that people  telegraph their intentions   well in this movie  the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans    they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head  this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better  or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced  embeth davidtzs character is not mysterious  just wooden  and kenneth branagh doesnt succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have  the bottom line  obvious plot  one note performances  unlikeable characters  and grotesque  southern  accents employed by british actors

Poorly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people I've ever seen.<br /><br />The film's ""plot"" focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the ""Jerry Farrelly Show"" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience: white-trash pornography. There's redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and degrading. African-Americans and working class America should be offended. (Howard Stern should be pleased however, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom. His was smart, funny and entertaining)<br /><br />MY GRADE: F+ (the daughter was hot)",0,ok  let me say that i didnt expect a film starring jerry springer to be cinematic gold  all i asked for was it to be cinematic   and it wasnt even that  it looked like someones bad home movies  poorly acted  scripted  and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people ive ever seen  the films  plot  focuses on a low class family who decide to go on the  jerry farrelly show  to discuss multiple affairs between a mother  daughter  stepfather and the daughters fiancee  from there  the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience  white trash pornography  theres redneck sex  interacial sex  even sex between jerry and his wife   yuk   this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision  at least it was mercifully short  disgusting and degrading  african americans and working class america should be offended   howard stern should be pleased however  he didnt squander his attempt for film stardom  his was smart  funny and entertaining  my grade  f   the daughter was hot 
"It's been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad.. The acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and I'm at a loss for words as to the execution. It was completely unoriginal. O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood's a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /><br />One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might never happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.",0,its been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad   the acting is very average  the story is horribly boring  and im at a loss for words as to the execution  it was completely unoriginal  o  and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwoods a pregnant schwarzenegger   one of the first scenes  the one with the television show   where the hell are you   got it right   the cast was 80  of lets face it   forgotten actors  if they were hoping for a career relaunch  then i think it might never happen with this on their cv  the script had the potential  but neither 80  of the actors nor the director  whos an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor  pulled it off  fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest  im sorry  but if you ever consider watching this   i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic  because not only its a total loss of time  but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like

"Pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. In La Gueule ouverte, he's dealing with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son as she dies of cancer. In A nos amours, the teenage girl's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family. Here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex-con. Her motivation is a little cloudy, since Loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than TV shows; on the other hand, he's got a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique--he would have been great as a rugby player).<br /><br />The casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert isn't allowed to give a bland, inexpressive performance (she has given many); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want--see the scene in the bar, where he's stabbed in the gut, runs away and seeks treatment, then soon restarts with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with those coal-black eyes and distressed look, plays Nelly's husband beautifully; it's a fine repeat of the pairing in Coup de foudre.",1,pialat films people in extreme emotional situations  usually with several violent scenes  in la gueule ouverte  hes dealing with the devastating effects on a womans husband and son as she dies of cancer  in a nos amours  the teenage girls sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family  here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex con  her motivation is a little cloudy  since loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows  on the other hand  hes got a fabulous body  i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique  he would have been great as a rugby player   the casting is impressive  isabelle huppert isnt allowed to give a bland  inexpressive performance  she has given many   depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want  see the scene in the bar  where hes stabbed in the gut  runs away and seeks treatment  then soon restarts with nelly  guy marchand  with those coal black eyes and distressed look  plays nellys husband beautifully  its a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre

"This movie is great. If you enjoy watching B-class movies, that is. This is a classic college 80's slasher movie, in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack.

I haven't always been a fan of Fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold. He gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't care for him anymore that will break your heart.

"On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed or are devilry it's very effective. But in Omen 4, it stunk.<br /><br />Delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child, rather she is a child with issues. Issues that maybe only a therapist, rather then a priest could help. She does not look scary or devilish. Rather, she looks sulky and moody.<br /><br />This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked. But it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies, as a made for TV movie special.<br /><br />On so many levels it lets down. It's cheap looking, the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not route for them. I recently re-watched it after someone brought it for me for Christmas, and it has dated appalling.<br /><br />If your thinking of watching this, then I would suggest that you don't.

"Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.<br /><br />The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still, what was there was interesting. The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF (the feature Still Life/Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong) which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in China itself.",1,reviewed at the world premiere screening sept  9  2006 at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival  tiff   this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste  recycled computers  keyboards  cables etc  shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back  and other desolation  the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship  still  what was there was interesting  the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens  intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking  the opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well  scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang je films at tiff  the feature still life sanxia haoren   the documentary dong  which were also built around that subject  director jennifer baichwal  producer nick de pencier  cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q a after the world premiere  producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself

"One of the best Tarzan films is also one of its most action packed (and graphic).<br /><br />Picking up a year or so after Tarzan the Ape Man, Niel Hamilton's Holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory. His Friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to win Jane back from Tarzan. Before they can leave Holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition. When they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded. They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire. Eventually Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures.<br /><br />Infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence (Its graphic even by todays standards. It probably would get a PG 13) and to remove all hint of nudity, (there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving Jane that is full frontal in its nudity, it was only recently restored). Its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for TV. As it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic, touching, action filled and everything else that a movie should be. Its an amazing film by almost any standard. Best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure, one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it, but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film. Its an amazing thing.<br /><br />I really like this film a great deal.<br /><br />If there are any flaws to the film, its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well. The rear screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing. However on almost every other level this film is top notch.<br /><br />You really owe it to yourself to see this.

"I don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. I love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake, especially for originality. Yes the Scarecrow is a Kung-Fu fighting frightner, but why not? No one else is willing to go that far. I really haven't had this much fun watching a movie since Candyman. So the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow, even his mom doesn't care about him. Then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the Scarecrow, who then goes on a Killing spree. His demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going. The dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors, but with most dedication towards Dario Argento really struck me as cool, these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre. Over the movie has a lot of Arnold rip offs, with one liners you'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick.

"While the original 1932 version, with Preston Foster, was good, there's no remake more worthy than this 1959 one, or more impossible to find anywhere, just as I strongly suspect Mickey Rooney to have had something to do with that. Never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant, or a script more thought-provoking, as well as an improvement upon the original. Many years after the last of my several viewings of this film, in 1970, I read an article in which Mickey Rooney was recounting a visit he'd made to death row, and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification he'd felt with people in similar circumstances. The article was about as short as the main character here, and didn't cover much, other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized, even in language I would not care to explicitly quote here. . . . . One of my main problems with capital punishment is that, of course, it is not evenly, impartially applied, just as many innocent people are far-too-carelessly, thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate. Another problem I have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough, or, for that matter, even publicly enough! The bible makes a special point, in such cases, about one of the more important purposes of such, as a deterrent, being ineffectually obscured, minus, not only a public viewing, but also the direct participation of all! As for those who claim to prove, statistically, that such is not an effective deterrent? In addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data, I have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking. However, I do have a problem about the fact that Robert Duvall, in The Apostle, had been punished at all, for his particular ""crime,"" or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a ""temporary insanity"" defense, as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case. . . . In addition to various other questions concerning the motives of Mickey Rooney for that particular visit he'd recounted, and about the answers to which I can only try to speculate, I suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature. I don't know exactly when he'd become the professing Christian he now makes it a special point, whenever possible, to emphasize that he is; but, as anybody should be well-aware, this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood, when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye. However, I have no particular bone of contention concerning that, per se, just as there's no doubt, scripturally speaking, that not all, and perhaps not even most, shall be spared the same ultimate fate, at the hands of the Lord Himself, as a result of His sacrifice on the cross. However, there is a problem, for me, about the spirit or attitude with which most professing Christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment; for, contrary to the Lord Himself, who would love to see everybody saved (Ezekiel 18:32) (II Peter 3:9), they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn! . . . What most people, on either side of this superlatively ever-burning issue, cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate, is that the Lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as He is hard. The two sides of His nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render Him mentally deranged, at least by any strictly human reckoning. Yet, regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in His nature surely is, there can be no doubt that anything short of it, or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation, falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth. Indeed, I've seen the most blood-curdling thirst for the same come out, self-contradictorily enough, on far-too-many occasions, whenever the categorically anti-death penalty advocates are confronted, even in the most rationally well-balanced ways, with the fact that, although the Lord died for everybody, not all are thereby going to be saved. After-all, in order to receive absolution, one must, to repeat the same term, reach out and receive it, that is, repent (Luke 13:3-5). Could anything make more sense? . . . But, then, what about the Lord's command to forgive, even in the case of one's enemies, of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation? One of the far-too-prevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality, as popularly misinterpreted, is the way it obscuringly over-simplifies the real meaning of forgiveness. The act of forgiveness does not, in itself, mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven. When one takes a clearly sober, rationally well-balanced view here, from the perspective of God's own attitude, all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way, seeing the light, and being granted mercy. This attitude is, of course, the very opposite of, say, that of Jonah, who actually resented it when God told him that his preaching to the people of Nineveh would result in their repentance. Jonah didn't want them to repent, but vindictively desired that they be destroyed. How self-righteously, cold-bloodedly like unto most professing Christians he was, save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most! I envy Jonah almost as much as he would me! However, minus the repentance of the one being forgiven, any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine Christian is not going to do him any good. In such a case, the only one to benefit is the real Christian himself!",1,while the original 1932 version  with preston foster  was good  theres no remake more worthy than this 1959 one  or more impossible to find anywhere  just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that  never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant  or a script more thought provoking  as well as an improvement upon the original  many years after the last of my several viewings of this film  in 1970  i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit hed made to death row  and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification hed felt with people in similar circumstances  the article was about as short as the main character here  and didnt cover much  other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized  even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here          one of my main problems with capital punishment is that  of course  it is not evenly  impartially applied  just as many innocent people are far too carelessly  thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate  another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough  or  for that matter  even publicly enough  the bible makes a special point  in such cases  about one of the more important purposes of such  as a deterrent  being ineffectually obscured  minus  not only a public viewing  but also the direct participation of all  as for those who claim to prove  statistically  that such is not an effective deterrent  in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data  i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking  however  i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall  in the apostle  had been punished at all  for his particular  crime   or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a  temporary insanity  defense  as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case        in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit hed recounted  and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate  i

"This is not a good movie. It's disjointed, all the acting is bad, and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better else where. Not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away. Worst of all, no one bothered to tell Lonette Mckee she can't sing. But who cares, she's sooooo damn good looking.

Bottom-line, hot girl group gets taken advantage of, some one gets hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on a guy, some one gets the hell out, and then the horrible stuff happens. Surprise, surprise.

"I think this movie is well done and realistic. I you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what lifts it above the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act.

"As always, controversial movies like this have mixed reviews. You either love it or you hate it, and not everyone will like this movie. This shows the perspective of the killers, which is something I personally feel is something important to consider. You may hate them, you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate, but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective.<br /><br />The movie is shot entirely using a hand-held camera, something that I think works quite well as it makes it more realistic. It is told completely from the killers point of view, from their ""missions"" to family outings, all leading up the big day ""Zero Day"" in which they are planning on a massacre at their school. Zero Day does not offer answers, but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves. Our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred, but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing. They are shown to be surprisingly normal, typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives, and if we didn't know what they were planning we wouldn't expect a thing (They make it clear throughout the whole movie that no-one else knows about their plan)<br /><br />The acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns. We can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future. Despite how this is a fictionalized movie, one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to Columbine. Calvin and Andre are scarily similar to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, (not so much in looks, but in manner) As someone who has researched Columbine very extensively, I could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it. <br /><br />The actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things I have ever seen. I was completely in shock after seeing it, and its a feeling that stays around for a while. It is very realistic and well-done, and it is very difficult to watch.<br /><br />All in all Zero Day is an excellent movie, and I think everyone should at least check it out. In the past, we have always simply branded killers ""psychopaths"" and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence, but as Zero Day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that, and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers.",1,as always  controversial movies like this have mixed reviews  you either love it or you hate it  and not everyone will like this movie  this shows the perspective of the killers  which is something i personally feel is something important to consider  you may hate them  you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate  but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective  the movie is shot entirely using a hand held camera  something that i think works quite well as it makes it more realistic  it is told completely from the killers point of view  from their  missions  to family outings  all leading up the big day  zero day  in which they are planning on a massacre at their school  zero day does not offer answers  but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves  our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred  but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing  they are shown to be surprisingly normal  typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives  and if we didnt know what they were planning we wouldnt expect a thing  they make it clear throughout the whole movie that no one else knows about their plan  the acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns  we can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future  despite how this is a fictionalized movie  one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to columbine  calvin and andre are scarily similar to eric harris and dylan klebold   not so much in looks  but in manner  as someone who has researched columbine very extensively  i could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it   the actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things i have ever seen  i was completely in shock after seeing it  and its a feeling that stays around for a while  it is very realistic and well done  and it is very difficult to watch  all in all zero day is an excellent movie  and i think everyone should at least check it out  in the past  we have always simply branded killers  psychopaths  and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence  but as zero day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that  and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers 
"Confounding melodrama taken from a William Gibson story, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads up posh, upscale rural nervous asylum, where his loose wife battles with self-appointed queen bee Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff-newcomer Lauren Bacall, who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child. Facetious and muddled, set in an indiscriminate time and place, and with a ""David and Lisa"" love story hidden in the plush morass. Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. For precisely an hour, most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library (this thread isn't used as symbolism, rather it's a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they're working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the roundabout way Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative, enlightening nor entertaining. ** from ****",0,confounding melodrama taken from a william gibson story  produced by john houseman and directed by vincente minnelli  richard widmark heads up posh  upscale rural nervous asylum  where his loose wife battles with self appointed queen bee lillian gish  and widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff newcomer lauren bacall  who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child  facetious and muddled  set in an indiscriminate time and place  and with a  david and lisa  love story hidden in the plush morass  widmark and bacall do have some good chemistry together  but this script gives them nothing to build on  for precisely an hour  most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library  this thread isnt used as symbolism  rather its a red herring in a non mystery    the picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when theyre working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right  but unfortunately the roundabout way minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative  enlightening nor entertaining     from

"OK I had higher hopes for this Carnosaur movie simply because it seemed like the sequels were getting better as they came out. I did like Carnosaur 2 better than 1. I figured well this one is newer so it must be better right? Well... I quickly learned I was wrong. I was extremely confused with the casting. They brought back Rick Dean for another spotlight character and Michael MacDonald as a police officer. Now for Rick dean lol, in Carnosaur 2 I thought he fit the role pretty well and wasn't really annoyed by him, now in Carnosaur 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier. Now we are getting goofy here. The movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and dinos escaping out of there little freezer trucks, but as soon as Scott Valentines team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs.<br /><br />I'll start with the raptors first, they had there tails drag the ground, which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 50-60 mph. Now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads didn't move at all. there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place.<br /><br />The t-rex was extremely pathetic, they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies. At least that one looked somewhat frightening. The one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time. The legs when it walked was hilarious, like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff legged and stuff. LOL another thing I noticed is that the hands did not move, they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded (god the sound effects were awful) retarded!!! Now if I was the director and realized that I had this to work with maybe I would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the fakeness fact. As for the rest of the movie, well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team I have ever seen. The weapons they used wouldn't make sense for the scenario. They even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming, now I was tickled at this scene because I thought that while this stupidity was going on that the Dinos would get in there and cause some damage. Instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time. I would like to look at this movie as the 3 stooges of dinosaur movies. You have retarded military, retarded dinosaurs, retarded scenario and you have a wonderful 83 minutes to spend of your day watching this.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying I wouldn't watch this, bc actually i do recommend everyone see this movie that wants 83 minutes of pure entertainment. It may seem like I'm ranting but really I'm hyping this movie up to what it is. Its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself, ""did the director really make this seriously?""",0,ok i had higher hopes for this carnosaur movie simply because it seemed like the sequels were getting better as they came out  i did like carnosaur 2 better than 1  i figured well this one is newer so it must be better right  well    i quickly learned i was wrong  i was extremely confused with the casting  they brought back rick dean for another spotlight character and michael macdonald as a police officer  now for rick dean lol  in carnosaur 2 i thought he fit the role pretty well and wasnt really annoyed by him  now in carnosaur 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier  now we are getting goofy here  the movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and dinos escaping out of there little freezer trucks  but as soon as scott valentines team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs  ill start with the raptors first  they had there tails drag the ground  which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 50 60 mph  now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads didnt move at all  there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place  the t rex was extremely pathetic  they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies  at least that one looked somewhat frightening  the one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time  the legs when it walked was hilarious  like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff legged and stuff  lol another thing i noticed is that the hands did not move  they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded  god the sound effects were awful  retarded    now if i was the director and realized that i had this to work with maybe i would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the fakeness fact  as for the rest of the movie  well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team i have ever seen  the weapons they used wouldnt make sense for the scenario  they even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming  now i was tickled at this scene because i thought that while this stupidity was going on that the dinos would get in there and cause some damage  instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time  i would like to look at this movie as the 3 stooges of dinosaur movies  you have retarded military  retarded dinosaurs  retarded scenario and you have a wonderful 83 minutes to spend of your day watching this  now im not saying i wouldnt watch this  bc actually i do recommend everyone see this movie that wants 83 minutes of pure entertainment  it may seem like im ranting but really im hyping this movie up to what it is  its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself   did the director really make this seriously  
"Well I'll start with the good points. The movie was only 86 minutes long, and some of it was so bad it was funny. Now for the low points. My first warning sign came with an actual ""warning"" on the film. When it started the following ""warning"" was displayed: ""The film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images. Because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun, pretty or romantic."" I should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then. The first words of the film were: ""I'm at the glue factory."" It was some guy talking on his phone, and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. I don't know why. So the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and starts imitating him. The budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. The acting was worse than me reading straight from a script. That's what is looked like they were doing. The script was horrible, and the big ""twist"" was that this guy who wrote a biography on the Zodiac Killer was actually the Zodiac Killer. Of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes. Without any more painful details of the plot, here were some horrible highlights of the movie. They try to make the Zodiac Killer compare himself to an ""army of one"" because soldiers are really just murderers. Then they tried to make an attempt at ""Satanic Worship"" by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting. The great ""computer hacker"" was able to get this kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number. For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to get someone address. I'm not sure why he didn't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason. I also learned that no matter where you get shot, blood will come out of your mouth within seconds.<br /><br />So if you like really bad acting, sub-par scripts, bad camera work and an obvious plot, you'll love Zodiac Killer!",0,well ill start with the good points  the movie was only 86 minutes long  and some of it was so bad it was funny  now for the low points  my first warning sign came with an actual  warning  on the film  when it started the following  warning  was displayed   the film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images  because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun  pretty or romantic   i should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then  the first words of the film were   im at the glue factory   it was some guy talking on his phone  and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory  i dont know why  so the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and starts imitating him  the budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find  the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script  thats what is looked like they were doing  the script was horrible  and the big  twist  was that this guy who wrote a biography on the zodiac killer was actually the zodiac killer  of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes  without any more painful details of the plot  here were some horrible highlights of the movie  they try to make the zodiac killer compare himself to an  army of one  because soldiers are really just murderers  then they tried to make an attempt at  satanic worship  by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting  the great  computer hacker  was able to get this kids address when someone gave him the kids name and phone number  for some reason he had to hack into the fbi to get someone address  im not sure why he didnt just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages com  there was also a random allusion to 9 11 for no reason  i also learned that no matter where you get shot  blood will come out of your mouth within seconds  so if you like really bad acting  sub par scripts  bad camera work and an obvious plot  youll love zodiac killer 
"In what would be his first screenplay, based on his own short story ""Turn About,"" William Faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice, and really strange relationships. The story originally was about only the Tone, Young, and Cooper characters, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract, and Faulkner obliged by creating a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co-stars' Young and Tone, leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph-like shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch (""Wuthering Heights"" performed in semaphore). Seriously, the almost entirely pronoun-less sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James.<br /><br />The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as may be found in his ""Sanctuary,"" and elsewhere). When Young proposes to Crawford, in Tone's presence, in lieu of an engagement ring ALL THREE exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another. The closeness of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially as they go off to their Thelma & Louise fate. Frankly, it's creepy.<br /><br />Not as creepy to this New Yorker, however, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, which Crawford cheerfully catches (and which is shown gamboling over her hands--I had to turn away!) and Young turns into a gladiator. Blech.<br /><br />That being said, there are some nice performances. Young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in Cooper's fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Cooper's flying buddy. Tone, despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a nice moment, dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy Young's fate.

"This is te cartoon that should have won instead of Country Cousin. Visually well-done and much more entertaining and memorable. Worth watching just for the music alone! Although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days, the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective. It's over sixty years old and it is, after all, just a cartoon. I'm disabled and if I were as hyper-sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage, I would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away. Sometimes you need to lighten up, put your head back and float! Caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering. Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion. *SIGH*",1,this is te cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin  visually well done and much more entertaining and memorable  worth watching just for the music alone  although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days  the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective  its over sixty years old and it is  after all  just a cartoon  im disabled and if i were as hyper sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage  i would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away  sometimes you need to lighten up  put your head back and float  caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering  bing crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion   sigh 
"I don't know what would be so great about this movie. Even worse, why should anyone bother seeing this one ? First of all there is no story. One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not do that either.<br /><br />You are just watching images for +/- 2 hrs. There are more useful things to do.<br /><br />I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above.

"I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then I'm pretty forgiving of movies. Although I tried, I just could not stand this movie at all, it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on. Although I know it's suppose to be a comedy but I didn't find it very funny. It was also an especially unrealistic, and jaded portrayal of rural life. In case this is what any of you think country life is like, it's definitely not. I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute, but the french guy was really fake. I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story, but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it, it's just too annoying.",0,i watched this movie really late last night and usually if its late then im pretty forgiving of movies  although i tried  i just could not stand this movie at all  it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on  although i know its suppose to be a comedy but i didnt find it very funny  it was also an especially unrealistic  and jaded portrayal of rural life  in case this is what any of you think country life is like  its definitely not  i do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute  but the french guy was really fake  i do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story  but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it  its just too annoying 
"As I said, the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert hadn't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll. What kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway? It sounded the same as her horrible Russian accent in another movie that I have seen her in. Every time she opened her mouth I cringed. It took 3 tries before I was able to watch the entire movie. Brad Johnson was good as the other lead. <br /><br />I really liked the beach location scenes. They added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of Melissa Gilberts depressing portrayal. I think they could have used San Francisco views more to their advantage though. It looked like the night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I don't recall the character in the book being this depressing. <br /><br />Please keep Melissa Gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent!",0,as i said  the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if melissa gilbert hadnt been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll  what kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway  it sounded the same as her horrible russian accent in another movie that i have seen her in  every time she opened her mouth i cringed  it took 3 tries before i was able to watch the entire movie  brad johnson was good as the other lead   i really liked the beach location scenes  they added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of melissa gilberts depressing portrayal  i think they could have used san francisco views more to their advantage though  it looked like the night scenes were actually sf  but i could be wrong  i dont recall the character in the book being this depressing   please keep melissa gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent 
"Sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting, emotional man-helping-man plea, in this case personified as German and French miners forced to be closed off from each other after the Great War thanks to a new border, leading to disillusionment on the German side, as the French are the bosses. But when a fire begins on the French side, the common decency of the German men lead to assistance, safety and even friendship. This was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade, as a certain man from Pabst's own side would break that piece and turn the Great War into merely a prelude. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism, as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant, cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work. Also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions, but real people, with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well. These are ordinary, working-class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man, and in this day of individualist opportunism, I'll take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that I think we can all aspire to.<br /><br />(Note: Apparently the ending is cut on most prints, where the French rebuild the mining gate, closing off the men once again. This is a brutal turn of events, and may have made the film a better overall film, but I would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence, so in short, I'm glad it was clipped.) {Grade: 8/10 (B) / #7 (of 11) of 1931}",1,sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting  emotional man helping man plea  in this case personified as german and french miners forced to be closed off from each other after the great war thanks to a new border  leading to disillusionment on the german side  as the french are the bosses  but when a fire begins on the french side  the common decency of the german men lead to assistance  safety and even friendship  this was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade  as a certain man from pabsts own side would break that piece and turn the great war into merely a prelude  but it is obvious to me that pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism  as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant  cynical adaptation of the threepenny opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work  also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions  but real people  with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well  these are ordinary  working class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man  and in this day of individualist opportunism  ill take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that i think we can all aspire to   note  apparently the ending is cut on most prints  where the french rebuild the mining gate  closing off the men once again  this is a brutal turn of events  and may have made the film a better overall film  but i would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence  so in short  im glad it was clipped    grade  8 10  b     7  of 11  of 1931

"Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I haven't seen it since I was in seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so I am not sure what effect it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression on me... and most of my friends. It did serve its purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly terrified of what the newly-converted post-rapture Christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast.

"Finally we get a TV series where we get to see the acting talent! Episode one was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, yeah, there was still the ""i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"" rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if -like so many TV soaps do. <br /><br />The camera work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary 'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' to add an ""artistic"" edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /><br />Nothing was over-dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant. It was SUCH a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script, a real opportunity!

"In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington takes a true story that also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this touch as a director.<br /><br />Recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of kids who have fallen through the cracks of public protection. This story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end.<br /><br />We can nit pick on some first effort problems with too many close ups and not the best of editing these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power cannot be understated.<br /><br />If the academy overlooks this film it will be travesty. This film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually doesn't transcend from a novel to the screen.

"As a teenager, I was pretty into the whole Bigfoot thing - I read the books and followed the reported sightings. As a more jaded adult, I've largely given up on the big guy now, but don't mind watching the odd movie when I come across one. This one had a few strong points to it - mainly, the recreations of two of the more famous Bigfoot encounters - the Ape Canyon incident of 1924 and the Bauman incident of c.1850 as related to and by Teddy Roosevelt, both of which I'm somewhat familiar with from that youthful reading I did. The movie takes for granted that both incidents involved a sasquatch, whereas both incidents have more plausible explanations, but the recreations were well done. There's also homage paid at the beginning of the movie to the famous Patterson video, again taking for granted its authenticity. The sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very well done and had a very creepy feel to it as the sasquatch were portrayed mainly in the shadows or as hairy feet running past the terrified men. Unfortunately, in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes, whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a half.<br /><br />It's the fictional story (done in a documentary style) of an expedition to a remote area of northern British Columbia, to the suspected home range of the sasquatch. A computer had targeted this area based on sightings and - in one of the more amusing scenes in the movie - the computer also used ""eyewitness sightings"" to draw a picture of a sasquatch that looked exactly like the ""creature"" of the Patterson video! Aside from those 20 minutes I mentioned, we basically watch this expedition travel, which means we get to watch a bunch of guys go on a long camping trip. I've been on camping trips with the guys. Let me tell you - they've never been worthy of a movie. Interspersed among the long stretches of boredom are some nice wildlife shots (although one suspects that canned footage was used, or perhaps even captive animals performing as wild animals) and there are some spectacular scenery shots, except that the scenery isn't of northern British Columbia, it's from national parks in Oregon.<br /><br />I did appreciate that we were never given a real picture of the sasquatch, so we didn't have to deal with the bad makeup that would have been part of this. 3/10",0,as a teenager  i was pretty into the whole bigfoot thing   i read the books and followed the reported sightings  as a more jaded adult  ive largely given up on the big guy now  but dont mind watching the odd movie when i come across one  this one had a few strong points to it   mainly  the recreations of two of the more famous bigfoot encounters   the ape canyon incident of 1924 and the bauman incident of c 1850 as related to and by teddy roosevelt  both of which im somewhat familiar with from that youthful reading i did  the movie takes for granted that both incidents involved a sasquatch  whereas both incidents have more plausible explanations  but the recreations were well done  theres also homage paid at the beginning of the movie to the famous patterson video  again taking for granted its authenticity  the sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very well done and had a very creepy feel to it as the sasquatch were portrayed mainly in the shadows or as hairy feet running past the terrified men  unfortunately  in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes  whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a half  its the fictional story  done in a documentary style  of an expedition to a remote area of northern british columbia  to the suspected home range of the sasquatch  a computer had targeted this area based on sightings and   in one of the more amusing scenes in the movie   the computer also used  eyewitness sightings  to draw a picture of a sasquatch that looked exactly like the  creature  of the patterson video  aside from those 20 minutes i mentioned  we basically watch this expedition travel  which means we get to watch a bunch of guys go on a long camping trip  ive been on camping trips with the guys  let me tell you   theyve never been worthy of a movie  interspersed among the long stretches of boredom are some nice wildlife shots  although one suspects that canned footage was used  or perhaps even captive animals performing as wild animals  and there are some spectacular scenery shots  except that the scenery isnt of northern british columbia  its from national parks in oregon  i did appreciate that we were never given a real picture of the sasquatch  so we didnt have to deal with the bad makeup that would have been part of this  3 10
"I've gotta say, I usually like horror movies that i've never seen... however, this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste. I'm used to the gory, gut wrenching types... but this particular movie was lame. The acting was horrible (yet the corny (no pun intended) one-liners were cute). And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow seem childish. If you want a movie to just pass the time, pick this one! The special effects are cheesy as heck. But seeing that it was a low budget movie, I can kind of see where that would come in. This will kind of remind you of the movie ""Children Of The Corn."" Independent movies rock.... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows going at it, then these movies would be for you.",0,ive gotta say  i usually like horror movies that ive never seen    however  this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste  im used to the gory  gut wrenching types    but this particular movie was lame  the acting was horrible  yet the corny  no pun intended  one liners were cute   and the sequel to it  scarecrow slayer was even worse  yes  probably  when it first came out  there was a huge rave about it and people liked it  but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out  movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish  if you want a movie to just pass the time  pick this one  the special effects are cheesy as heck  but seeing that it was a low budget movie  i can kind of see where that would come in  this will kind of remind you of the movie  children of the corn   independent movies rock     most of the time  so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs  or in the sequel  2 scarecrows going at it  then these movies would be for you 
"I saw two movies over the weekend, One was ""kaal"" and the other ""Waqt"". Both movies are made in ""Bollywood"" but they are worlds apart. The fundamental difference is the Story and the Director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with ""Ankhen"", one of the best Comedy Hindi movies. His Casting of the Charecteres is perfect. The story apparently taken from a Gujerati Play is awesome,the treatment is superb with some exceptions. In Bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a Bollywood Director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy (mediocre Malik in this instance)is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good Director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease the Finacier and the Grandma's who just cant get enough of these numbers. No Music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie. None of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the Bharat-Natyam. The duelling and role playing the Father and Son is good acting by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie. Then we have a cheap classless tasteless Producer like Sharukh Khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like ""Kaal"" to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of Art, and they surround themselves with borderline talent, and they recoup the investment before the word gets around. These are the Bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner ""Film Farce"" awards given by Bollywood Chamcha's and most of them are in the Media.",1,i saw two movies over the weekend  one was  kaal  and the other  waqt   both movies are made in  bollywood  but they are worlds apart  the fundamental difference is the story and the director  vipul shaw made his indelible mark with  ankhen   one of the best comedy hindi movies  his casting of the charecteres is perfect  the story apparently taken from a gujerati play is awesome the treatment is superb with some exceptions  in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy  mediocre malik in this instance is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract  so even a good director like vipul shah has to use them to appease the finacier and the grandmas who just cant get enough of these numbers  no music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie  none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the bharat natyam  the duelling and role playing the father and son is good acting by bachachan and akshay kumar  his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding  a good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie  then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like sharukh khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like  kaal  to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of art  and they surround themselves with borderline talent  and they recoup the investment before the word gets around  these are the bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner  film farce  awards given by bollywood chamchas and most of them are in the media

"Like all the Taviani Brothers films, this one looks great, but it is rotten to the core with false romanticism, and coincidences heap upon each other in some facsimile of a ""story"".

"Once upon a time there was a director by the name of James. He brought us wonderfully, thrilling science-fiction such as Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry. Terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era.<br /><br />.......and then it happened...................1997........countless awards..........obscene amounts of money............outlandish barrage of advertising............maximum profit margin........Titanic was here!<br /><br />I have never (ever) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it, in fact I have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going. Titanic however was a film I only took one single positive out of - that of Kate Winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout!<br /><br />Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more wooden than my nephew's tree house, images meant to terrify were actually comical (man falling from ship and hitting propeller), historically false (don't even get me started because there's too much), it had dire theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the pointless love story was so tedious, self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved (I was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not).<br /><br />It was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to MTV watching, bubblegum chewing, boy-with-car chasing, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band) who would drag their sex-starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick-flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point. Millions of dumbed down, culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because ""it cost so much to produce it must be great"" and ""Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies"". <br /><br />The crowning glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based. It looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people. <br /><br />However, if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off. Good luck to Hollywood if that is how they want to make money, I'd do it if I had those kind of chances in life!<br /><br />It is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly, historically false/human interest tripe like ""The Patriot"" and ""Pearl Harbor"".",0,once upon a time there was a director by the name of james  he brought us wonderfully  thrilling science fiction such as terminator and aliens  these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry  terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era         and then it happened                   1997        countless awards          obscene amounts of money            outlandish barrage of advertising            maximum profit margin        titanic was here  i have never  ever  been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it  in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going  titanic however was a film i only took one single positive out of   that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout  quickly   the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills 90210  the acting was more wooden than my nephews tree house  images meant to terrify were actually comical  man falling from ship and hitting propeller   historically false  dont even get me started because theres too much   it had dire theme music  up there with the bodyguard for cheese  and the pointless love story was so tedious  self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved  i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not   it was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv watching  bubblegum chewing  boy with car chasing  teenage girls  decaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band  who would drag their sex starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick flick hoping to get lucky later  the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point  millions of dumbed down  culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because  it cost so much to produce it must be great  and  steve and barbara said it was good and they know their movies    the crowning glory arrived when titanic swept the boards at the academy awards  king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based  it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people   however  if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off  good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to make money  id do it if i had those kind of chances in life  it is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly  historically false human interest tripe like  the patriot  and  pearl harbor

In this case the term ""dark psychological thriller.""

Festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults. Wow, I bet Freud would be really impressed! Too many would be film makers like Kallio, who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades, fail to dig their own fresh grave.

"Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. The Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A great plot. A great twist. A great eye candy. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest movies apart from ""Scream"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) a struggling hotel manager, boards a late Red Eye back to LA. Little does she know that she has been followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. Later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security who is staying in Lisa's hotel. And what does this have to with Lisa. Well, she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him, if she doesn't Ripner will murder her father (Brian Cox). The twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it. Overall, definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005.

"Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) heads out with his local Jindabyne, Australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest, recreation, and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman's body floating face-down in a river, things appear to have turned out for the worst. The largest casualty of the weekend is the men's commonsense. They don't hike out of the ravine, and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches. Then they head out and report the body.<br /><br />The town and the men's lives quickly turn into a mess. The local media swarms them, and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives. Stewart's wife Claire (Laura Linney, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but has to battle with it through her own mental illness.<br /><br />Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, splayed out on a morgue slab. Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and outcast.<br /><br />The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids: Stewart and Claire's son who is being led around by a half-breed Aussie who's mother was killed also just a few years before. The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can, and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this (again, the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised).<br /><br />Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface, yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface). None, that is, until Claire forces them to.<br /><br />The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted. There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn't get done; too many loose threads. The acting was okay, but the filming was terrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production.<br /><br />I enjoy symbolic films, NORTHFORK being one of my all-time favorites in that vein.

"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even said as much at the premiere. This is a drama, but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was. That's never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates/bandmates. They were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously. The cheesy dropping of Beatles lyrics was just absurd. The soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you're one of those crazy, rabid Dominic Monaghan fans, don't bother with this one.",0,this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen  i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed  the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere  this is a drama  but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was  thats never a good sign  the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as liviens roommates bandmates  they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously  the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd  the soundtrack was excellent  however  and was probably the best part of the movie  unless youre one of those crazy  rabid dominic monaghan fans  dont bother with this one 
"I was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons. For the first half hour it's actually pretty decent. Although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video, its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad. In fact I almost thought this would be almost as good as Perico Ripiao (another recent Dominican film) which turned out to be MUCH MUCH better than I expected. The plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in Dominican society as a whole, which makes for a good premise especially in The Dominican Republic. Unfortunately I don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter, and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them. About 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits. Not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge, space age, CGI effects dating to what I'm guessing would be the 70's, but the whole plot just goes down the drain. The rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations, and clever one liners. To top it all off (and I guess I should warn you now **SPOILER ALERT**) it all turns out to be a dream. Oh my who didn't see that coming? Oh man I almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie. Well after about an hour into it I start thinking ""hmmmm something just doesn't seem right about the sound track but what can it be??"" and then it hits me HALF OF THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE WAS TAKEN FROM A VIDEO GAME CALLED KING OF FIGHTER 95.<br /><br />When oh when DR will you give us a film we can call a work of art?!?!

"After reading several comments, I felt I had to add in my two cents as well. ""Sorrow Lost"" is one of the most memorable shorts I think I have ever seen. I had gotten the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short amount of time. The story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father. She is soon given the choice to ""stop"" him by a demon played by ""Witchblade's Eric Etebari."" Having watched the show, I was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The acting was absolutely superb by him. The girl's was okay and the father's was decent. There is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare you get to see such a high quality short. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film. This isn't to say that it's not without its flaws - I thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long. But this stuck in my head days after watching it.

"I am glad to read so many negative comments about the Tritter plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They like House's gruff nature and his intelligence, but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot. It cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority. It needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital. Also, there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what Tritter is actually doing. He alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. A lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray. I voted the episode awful not because of the story itself, but when you insert the Trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it, People say they hate to watch the story lines anymore. Please change it. Get Tritter out.",0,i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot  everyone i talk to says the same thing  they like houses gruff nature and his intelligence  but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot  it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority  it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital  also  there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing  he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients  a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray  i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself  but when you insert the trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it  people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore  please change it  get tritter out 
"Paul Verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'Basic Instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabbé); a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there, he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things I like best about him. This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesn't happen very often!). I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but you'll see what I mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one I've mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half...lovely.<br /><br />The acting in The Fourth Man isn't anything to write home about, but it's solid throughout. Jeroen Krabbé holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct, but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view, all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish, but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films I've seen, this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me, it's worth the effort.",1,paul verhoevens predecessor to his breakout hit basic instinct is a stylish and shocking neo noir thriller  verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films  both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why  the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve  played by jeroen krabbé   a gay  alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes  while there  he meets the seductive christine halsslag  renée soutendijk  who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him  even if it kills him  paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film  and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it  many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be  but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration  and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on  paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself  and that is one of things i like best about him  this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards  and that doesnt happen very often    i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work   but youll see what i mean when you see the film  make sure you get the uncut version    there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one ive mentioned  but are lovely nonetheless  a man gets eaten by lions  another one has a pipe sent through his skull  a boat is smashed in half   lovely  the acting in the fourth man isnt anything to write home about  but its solid throughout  jeroen krabbé holds the audiences attention and looks the part as the drunken writer  it is renée soutendijk that impresses the most  though  as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale  her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct  but the original fatale did it best  paul verhoevens direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view  all of which help to create the mystery of the story  verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish  but he obviously has talent and its a shame that he doesnt put it to better use  of all the verhoeven films ive seen  this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across  trust me  its worth the effort 
"Despite some reviews being distinctly Luke-warm, I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young Queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.",1,despite some reviews being distinctly luke warm  i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as mills and boon  so what  it is good to see a warm  touching story of real love in these cynical times  many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes  you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other  even though  for political reasons  it was an arranged marriage  i did feel though that sir john conroy  who was desperate to control the young queen  is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain  as it is rumoured that he was in fact  the real father of victoria  as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent  it would have been interesting to explore this theory  emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess  trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her  she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england  which prospered as never before  under her long reign  i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie 
"Hard to imagine this film is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart-stirring. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character. Watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience.<br /><br />The movie is not so pessimistic as I thought before, the story is kinda bright and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normals, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes.<br /><br />One important factor of Christy's success is his mother's support which seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman uses her all to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky for Christy!And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as young Christy, what a performance for a child! The love story of Christy is very well-done, trustful. Christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love, his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed with her role in Harry Potter series, the loathsome Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth...) is paranoiac and offensive, I do have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and agony are just next to each other.<br /><br />Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying', god knows why he chose to direct that crap! Really a career taint for him, what a pity!",1,hard to imagine this film is based on a true story  and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart stirring  daniel day lewis is a chameleon  really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character  watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience  the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before  the story is kinda bright and intriguing  christy is not despised by the normals  his life is also colorful and delightful  although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes  one important factor of christys success is his mothers support which seems to be more touching  and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role  this fat little middle aged woman uses her all to make christys dream come true  so lucky for christy and hugh oconor is also excellent as young christy  what a performance for a child  the love story of christy is very well done  trustful  christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love  his crush on the beautiful dr  eileen cole  surprisingly played by fiona shaw  i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series  the loathsome aunt petunia  so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind  but anyway  any woman has her own youth     is paranoiac and offensive  i do have sympathy for him  love is a two edged sword  happiness and agony are just next to each other  btw  jim sheridans works are all good  in america  the boxer etc   except get rich or die trying  god knows why he chose to direct that crap  really a career taint for him  what a pity 
"The freedom of having your own Sea Going Power Boat, the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged,an's man of an adventurer and lovely(and so well endowed!) assistants in fine Bikinis were all definite selling points for ""SEA HUNT""(1958-61).<br /><br />Just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going ""gun for hire""* series. Let's look closely now. There must be a some clues around.<br /><br />If we were to look back just a little, we see the RKO Radio Pictures production of UNDERWATER! (1955). It starred Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive Scuba Diving Adventurers working on salvage in the Carribbean, including a Pre-Fidel Cuba. The film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits. Fine, shapely Women Folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) are always a plus for the Guys; and the presence of rugged, athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake ""poses"" is equally pleasing to the Gals.<br /><br />And there is one element that is a true legacy of this old RKO Feature. It is on the Soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes. It is the Recording of ""It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White"", written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso Perez Prado and His Orchestra.<br /><br />Anyone who hears this Insturmental or Song (with Lyrics)will not soon forget it. Its Carribbean Beat is so very lively and its rich use of the Brass Section of the Orchestra is Powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory. The 45 RPM Record of this Song made it to the Top 10 most Popular Songs of the Week for many Saturday Evenings on NBC TV's ""YOUR HIT PARADE"". We can't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got. (Maybe some one can fill us in on that one item, please!) So, we got back to ""SEA HUNT"" and its own odyssey in getting on ""the Tube"".

Mr. Bridges had been around for approximately 15 years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of Boston Blackie movies (with Chester Morris)to THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS(1951).<br /><br />Lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization, along with a fine, convincingly athletic physique, having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities. He took very well as the Diver's Diver, whether it's performing duties on board ship, or fathoms beneath the Sea.<br /><br />And Lloyd did take to the role quickly, but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there, he was not familiar with S.C.U.B.A.*** prior to landing this Mike Nelson gig. But the Athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a quick learner, as so many of the close-up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it, that it was Lloyd with the mask, the bubbler(air tank) and the flipper fins.<br /><br />Stories almost always involved the helping-out some client for pay, much like a Private Detective would. So what if the client was a lovely Lady who looked good in the Bathing Suit, all the better.<br /><br />Like so many of the other ZIV/UNITED ARTISTS TV Productions,""SEA HUNT"" possessed a fine, haunting Opening Theme and Closing, along with some original incidental music and queues.<br /><br />At one time, I believe that ""SEA HUNT"" was the top syndicated TV Series, a success that ZIV Series had known before with the likes of ""SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE""and ""HIGHWAY PATROL"". As far as the showing venue for this underwater saga, here in Chicago it was shown late night (after 10:30 P.M.) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC Affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV).<br /><br />And I can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was. And there were even on scene commercials done by the Star! How well we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson, riding on his Power Boat.

Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin' the makers of Old Style Lager Beer!"", all while Mike was toasting us, raising an Old Style Bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drinking Beer on your moving Boat! We're tellin' the Coast Guard!)

"This was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community, something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we're not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools. After the basic version download ( die hard fan here on a dial-up modem ) eventually got here I hit my first snag. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server. Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly.

"Everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap... on tv. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realisator-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see : the first is the Pacula ? ""Sophie 's choice"" with Meryl Streep. The second is ""Journey of Hope"". As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also have to struggle against racism and fascim. We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our earth companion. This wonderful film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace.

"Movie had some good acting and good moments (though obviously pretty low budget), but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed. The main point of conflict between the two leads doesn't play out in a realistic manner at all. There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it, but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently, especially since the employment of Glenn is so wound up in this part of his life (and Adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money.) Also, several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is (apologizing to Adam for his past) while Adam is shown to be upstanding and ""traditional,"" which the film proclaims to be the ""good"" way in the end. I don't like being preached to like that. I attended a discussion session with the director after viewing LTR, and he said that he presented this conflict between them because, if he was in Glenn's shoes (and he said he does in real life relate to Glenn's view) that he could never date someone with Adam's views. Well, then, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film. Also, director said he directed this, his first movie, only after reading (Directing For Dummies.) Directing was not that bad, but far from a top notch effort. I've seen worse, but I rarely leave films feeling this frustrated.",0,movie had some good acting and good moments  though obviously pretty low budget   but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed  the main point of conflict between the two leads doesnt play out in a realistic manner at all  there are a few scenes where they disagree because of it  but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently  especially since the employment of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life  and adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money   also  several times glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is  apologizing to adam for his past  while adam is shown to be upstanding and  traditional   which the film proclaims to be the  good  way in the end  i dont like being preached to like that  i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing ltr  and he said that he presented this conflict between them because  if he was in glenns shoes  and he said he does in real life relate to glenns view  that he could never date someone with adams views  well  then  i think he should have done a much better job explaining how glenn could do it in the film  also  director said he directed this  his first movie  only after reading  directing for dummies   directing was not that bad  but far from a top notch effort  ive seen worse  but i rarely leave films feeling this frustrated

Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels. I never thought that I would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did. Al Pacino isn't acting in this film: he's posing. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is a race car driver, just staring at the camera. He's perfectly awful. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in a love affair, and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever. Sydney Pollack directed this film? There's no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here.

"I was glad to watch this movie free of charge as I am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library. Nothing against low budget movies, but this movie has horrible acting and directing. How can a movie as this one ever be made. The director should be blacklisted, and for all the poor actors, it is for sure not a jumping board into a career. Please make sure that you'll not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and directing awful. There are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the ""LOW 10"". Another example would be ""Dracula 3000"". People who make money with this movie should give it to charity, so at least it serves for a good reason. <br /><br />In this case I would watch it even another 10 (or at least one more time).",0,i was glad to watch this movie free of charge as i am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library  nothing against low budget movies  but this movie has horrible acting and directing  how can a movie as this one ever be made  the director should be blacklisted  and for all the poor actors  it is for sure not a jumping board into a career  please make sure that youll not watch this movie  the acting is lame  the camera and directing awful  there are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the  low 10   another example would be  dracula 3000   people who make money with this movie should give it to charity  so at least it serves for a good reason   in this case i would watch it even another 10  or at least one more time  
"In a series chock-full of brilliant episodes, this one stands out as one of my very favorites. It's not the most profound episode, there's no great meaning or message. But it's a lot of fun, and there are some fine performances.<br /><br />But what makes it really stand out for me is that it is, to my knowledge, the *only* Twilight Zone episode with a *double* snapper ending. The Zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story. But this time, you get a surprise, and think that's that, but it turns out there's *another* surprise waiting. I just like that so much, that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other being a deeper, more message-oriented one).",1,in a series chock full of brilliant episodes  this one stands out as one of my very favorites  its not the most profound episode  theres no great meaning or message  but its a lot of fun  and there are some fine performances  but what makes it really stand out for me is that it is  to my knowledge  the  only  twilight zone episode with a  double  snapper ending  the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story  but this time  you get a surprise  and think thats that  but it turns out theres  another  surprise waiting  i just like that so much  that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes  the other being a deeper  more message oriented one

"Gómez Pereira is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest Spanish cinema (just take a look at his curriculum vitae), so I didn't expect that much of ""Cosas Que Hacen...""...

He's last work deals with the midlife crisis, the disappointing, and the seeking for a second chance after you've ruined it all. The last half hour of the movie (the more dramatic) is the best part, and it just makes worth watching the film.

"The trick to creating a good, solid mystery story is as much a matter of timing as its about plot contrivances, colorful characters or surprising twists. Anyone who has ever labored in frustration with an un-finishable Sunday New York Times crossword knows that any puzzle that takes too long to solve ceases to be any fun. The best murder mysteries, be they on film or in print, are slight affairs that get to the point, spell out their clues, line up their suspects and, hopefully, zap us with a few surprises; being complicated without being unduly confusing. And they play fair; on second, third and fourth viewings of the clues and red herrings we should be just as pleased to marvel at how well it all comes together as we were at being surprised in the first place. Indeed, good thrillers should get better on repeated viewings as we anticipate the double and triple crosses.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet's comedy-thriller DEATHTRAP, as derived from Ira Levin's hit Broadway play, is a great example. It moves along at a tidy clip, skillfully juggling its clues, being (almost) totally honest with us (even when it is lying to us) and yet never revealing where it is going (even when it is telling us where it might go). It is less a murder mystery movie in the traditional vane than it is a movie about murder mysteries, derived from a play about playwriting. Rather than going backward -- a murder and then an investigation to explain why everything happened -- DEATHTRAP leads us through the crime(s) step by step, leaving ample room for the unexpected; as the ads advise it is less a ""whodunit"" than a ""who'lldoit."" <br /><br />DEATHTRAP is often compared (unfavorably, oddly enough) to the play and movie versions of SLEUTH, though in reality it has much more in common with SCREAM, the self-mocking essay on teeny-bopper horror flicks. Like that clever film, DEATHTRAP labels itself (a thriller about thrillers), sets it parameters (""a one-set, five character moneymaker"") and then proceeds to deconstruct its genre by revealing itself as ""the most outlandish and preposterous set of circumstances entertaining enough to persuade an audience to suspend its disbelief."" <br /><br />DEATHTRAP bravely gives us a mystery with only five major characters, two of which are of minimum importance. Henry Jones as a cagey lawyer is on hand mostly for exposition (and to supply us with his penchant for folksy charm) and Irene Worth is all quirks and comic relief as a psychic-cum-sleuth who acts as the nominal detective. That leaves three main characters to be the killer(s) and/or the victim(s): It is a testament to Michael Caine's abilities that as Sidney Bruhl, a down-on-his-luck author of mystery plays, he creates a character who we intrinsically like and trust, even as we recognize immediately that almost everything he says is a lie. As his adoring, if somewhat ditzy wife, Myra, Dyan Canon flirts with being over the top by giving a roller-coaster ride of a performance with a character that by turns seems to be frail or overbearing, crafty or hysterical, timid or bold and uncompromisingly in love with a less than reciprocating Sidney. The third angle of this unexpected triangle is a fledgling playwright named Clifford Anderson played by Christopher Reeve in such a way that we never quite get a handle on just who his character is: enthusiastic preppie wannabe writer, semi-innocent victim or cunningly charming sociopath. As the various character dance around each other, the cleverly dour script adapted by ace scribe Jay Presson Allen manages to be consistently amusing, even as it builds suspense. And even after the final twist (an improvement over the play's finale), it may not be quite clear just who has manipulated who to do what.<br /><br />Lumet is by no means a master of comedy, so he lets his able cast have free reign to flesh out the characters and they all give sharp, theatrical, yet subtle work, with Reeve being particularly noteworthy. But what Lumet does so well is to work skillfully in tight quarters. As he did brilliantly in 12 ANGRY MEN, he takes a one-set play, and with a minimum of opening up, manages to make what could have been cramped, stagy and stagnant seem endlessly photogenic and spacious. The setting, a country home converted from an old windmill, is relatively small, but as designed by Tony Walton it manages to be both cozy and charming, as well as spooky and treacherous. It is so truly difficult to tell where the studio set and the real country house cross boundaries that to a degree the set becomes a sixth character. And as the scene of the crime, it is a most inviting deathtrap indeed.",1,the trick to creating a good  solid mystery story is as much a matter of timing as its about plot contrivances  colorful characters or surprising twists  anyone who has ever labored in frustration with an un finishable sunday new york times crossword knows that any puzzle that takes too long to solve ceases to be any fun  the best murder mysteries  be they on film or in print  are slight affairs that get to the point  spell out their clues  line up their suspects and  hopefully  zap us with a few surprises  being complicated without being unduly confusing  and they play fair  on second  third and fourth viewings of the clues and red herrings we should be just as pleased to marvel at how well it all comes together as we were at being surprised in the first place  indeed  good thrillers should get better on repeated viewings as we anticipate the double and triple crosses  sidney lumets comedy thriller deathtrap  as derived from ira levins hit broadway play  is a great example  it moves along at a tidy clip  skillfully juggling its clues  being  almost  totally honest with us  even when it is lying to us  and yet never revealing where it is going  even when it is telling us where it might go   it is less a murder mystery movie in the traditional vane than it is a movie about murder mysteries  derived from a play about playwriting  rather than going backward    a murder and then an investigation to explain why everything happened    deathtrap leads us through the crime s  step by step  leaving ample room for the unexpected  as the ads advise it is less a  whodunit  than a  wholldoit    deathtrap is often compared  unfavorably  oddly enough  to the play and movie versions of sleuth  though in reality it has much more in common with scream  the self mocking essay on teeny bopper horror flicks  like that clever film  deathtrap labels itself  a thriller about thrillers   sets it parameters   a one set  five character moneymaker   and then proceeds to deconstruct its genre by revealing itself as  the most outlandish and preposterous set of circumstances entertaining enough to persuade an audience to suspend its disbelief    deathtrap bravely gives us a mystery with only five major characters  two of which are of minimum importance  henry jones as a cagey lawyer is on hand mostly for exposition  and to supply us with his penchant for folksy charm  and irene worth is all quirks and comic relief as a psychic cum sleuth who acts as the nominal detective  that leaves three main characters to be the killer s  and or the victim s   it is a testament to michael caines abilities that as sidney bruhl  a down on his luck author of mystery plays  he creates a character who we intrinsically like and trust  even as we recognize immediately that almost everything he says is a lie  as his adoring  if somewhat ditzy wife  myra  dyan canon flirts with being over the top by giving a roller coaster ride of a performance with a character that by turns seems to be frail or overbearing  crafty or hysterical  timid or bold and uncompromisingly in love with a less than reciprocating sidney  the third angle of this unexpected triangle is a fledgling playwright named clifford anderson played by christopher reeve in such a way that we never quite get a handle on just who his character is  enthusiastic preppie wannabe writer  semi innocent victim or cunningly charming sociopath  as the various character dance around each other  the cleverly dour script adapted by ace scribe jay presson allen manages to be consistently amusing  even as it builds suspense  and even after the final twist  an improvement over the plays finale   it may not be quite clear just who has manipulated who to do what  lumet is by no means a master of comedy  so he lets his able cast have free reign to flesh out the characters and they all give sharp  theatrical  yet subtle work  with reeve being particularly noteworthy  but what lumet does so well is to work skillfully in tight quarters  as he did brilliantly in 12 angry men  he takes a one set play  and with a minimum of opening up  manages to make what could have been cramped  stagy and stagnant seem endlessly photogenic and spacious  the setting  a country home converted from an old windmill  is relatively small  but as designed by tony walton it manages to be both cozy and charming  as well as spooky and treacherous  it is so truly difficult to tell where the studio set and the real country house cross boundaries that to a degree the set becomes a sixth character  and as the scene of the crime  it is a most inviting deathtrap indeed 
"Forget the campy 'religious' movies that have monopolized the television/film market... this movie has a real feel to it. While it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws, it also has that message of forgiveness, and overall good morals.

"Kitten Natividad, of Russ Meyer film fame, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?) that is supposed to have healing powers. After going down on some of this fruit (which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks) Chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super-hero, specifically, The Double D Avenger. Note that she's also wearing a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, that all sounds pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she's taking away their business so some of the strippers (including Haji, also of Russ Meyer film fame) go after her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights back in the guise of the Double D Avenger. Watch her do a ""Wonder Woman"" type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow. With the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70's ""live action"" kid's show with adult content, although while this is unrated it could probably get away with PG-13 at the worst. And it's probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered. This makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison. Special appearance by Forest J.

"This was my first, and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I was eager to get into it, as it featured Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and was a film By Theo, of whom I've heard a lot. The opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The movie had big holes and I don't know which to mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15 minutes monologue, killing the action and viewers patience, nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart this old lady telling a story. All that is presumed to be shown through action, was simply told to the camera by the old lady. In a moment, the equippe of TV was heading to the bar. They turn the corner and immediately the winter begins! Probably, shot in different days, continuity leaked. A lot of problems with the story-telling, it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style, making the viewer asking questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni, given a role which lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people would agree with, the movies showed lot of historic, ethnic, or politically incorrectness, just for the sake of making a movie about ""humanity"" as a red in another review.

"Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my b.s. detector goes off. Usually, a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them, but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk. So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews, I was apprehensive, especially since I was not a fan of his other ""uplifting"" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN. For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film, it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us.<br /><br />I needn't have worried. THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one. Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part. There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without, and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much, but those are only quibbles. There's no heavy-handed message, no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions, and no condescension towards us and its characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build its own power, and it does, so by the final scene, we are genuinely moved.<br /><br />Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part. He really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still perseveres, and except for those homilies, the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental, because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long. And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make some peace, not only with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also does fine, unmannered work as Straight's daughter.

"The US State Dept. would not like us to see this movie, because they have a beef with the Iranian govt. However, it shows us just how civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the film, which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest of terms: the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium, which is strictly limited to male audiences alone. The film is hilariously funny, and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie intensely. Five girls try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between Iran and Bahrain.

"This is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single yet doesn't have a clue how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he really makes no effort at all!<br /><br />He has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood (he's 28 and admits he's never had sex).<br /><br />Very good outdoor shots of Paris and Rouen, where the two software people travel on business. They try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail. My theory is that they're trying the wrong places - they go to more-or-less 'youth' nightclubs; they should try the type that has older people, more their own age.<br /><br />Harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de Niro effort, as in Taxi Driver, urging his friend/colleague to go and stab some bloke who's pulled a nice-looking girl in the nightclub.<br /><br />Worth watching.",1,this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man  phillipe harel as notre heros is a bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver  inspector clouseau  in his stoicism  and chauncey gardiner in being there  also peter sellers   he is single yet doesnt have a clue how to attract the opposite sex   in fact  he really makes no effort at all  he has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom   his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood  hes 28 and admits hes never had sex   very good outdoor shots of paris and rouen  where the two software people travel on business  they try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail  my theory is that theyre trying the wrong places   they go to more or less youth nightclubs  they should try the type that has older people  more their own age  harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de niro effort  as in taxi driver  urging his friend colleague to go and stab some bloke whos pulled a nice looking girl in the nightclub  worth watching 
"Here's how you do it: Believe in God and repent for your sins. Then things should turn around within the next day or so. <br /><br />Until the last fifteen minutes, this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk's crappy life. His mom dies. His stepmom's a b_tch. His dad dies. He drinks. He gets married. He has kids. He drinks some more. His wife gets mad. He disappoints his kids. The wife threatens to leave. He calls up a reverend late night b/c he wants to kill himself. Then after the recap happens, that's when we get the ""Left Behind""-like subtle message.<br /><br />""He needed a paycheck"". This is the phrase I had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so I wouldn't lose my respect for Madsen.<br /><br />Madsen drops to his knees and begs Christ's forgiveness. Once he does, he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he's found God and that's good enough for her. Flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church. End the movie as Madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? He gives a little dismissive wave to the bar (i.e. sin house) and give a gay, Miami-Vice, after-school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze-frames. See why I had to repeat the phrase? ""He needed a paycheck"".<br /><br />Man this movie is bad. The B-Grade 80's production values don't help much. The script could have easily been a ""Touched By An Angel"" episode. It could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials. The acting is wooden and never believable. Even Madsen, of whom I'm a big fan and is the sole reason I sat through this, makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesn't know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera. 45 minutes into it I started to get discouraged. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to put it away and say that alright, I saw half of it. That's good enough. But no. If I sat through Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit throughout this.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great seeing the opening title ""Introducing Michael Madsen"". Sue me. 2) Some of the Dialogue is so bad that it's classic. I'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too.<br /><br />That's about it. To wrap it up ,this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE TARGET, MY BOSS'S DAUGHTER, etc). Now I've gotta rewatch Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him. See ya, Kids.<br /><br />""This stuff's gonna make me go blind, but I'm gonna drink it anyway"" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol<br /><br />""I don't understand! Everything seems so beautiful!"" - Madsen walking outside after confessing to God<br /><br />""I'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and I'm gonna get a haircut too"" - Madsen after converting at the dinner table, because Satan lives in your hair",0,heres how you do it  believe in god and repent for your sins  then things should turn around within the next day or so   until the last fifteen minutes  this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunks crappy life  his mom dies  his stepmoms a b tch  his dad dies  he drinks  he gets married  he has kids  he drinks some more  his wife gets mad  he disappoints his kids  the wife threatens to leave  he calls up a reverend late night b c he wants to kill himself  then after the recap happens  thats when we get the  left behind  like subtle message   he needed a paycheck   this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i wouldnt lose my respect for madsen  madsen drops to his knees and begs christs forgiveness  once he does  he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way  he tells his wife that hes found god and thats good enough for her  flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church  end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol  final moment  he gives a little dismissive wave to the bar  i e  sin house  and give a gay  miami vice  after school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze frames  see why i had to repeat the phrase   he needed a paycheck   man this movie is bad  the b grade 80s production values dont help much  the script could have easily been a  touched by an angel  episode  it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials  the acting is wooden and never believable  even madsen  of whom im a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this  makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesnt know his a   from his elbow yet on camera  45 minutes into it i started to get discouraged  this thing was like homework  i just wanted to put it away and say that alright  i saw half of it  thats good enough  but no  if i sat through cheerleader ninjas  i could sit throughout this  the only reason im not giving this thing a 1 is for two points  1  i love madsen  i know its not fair  but its great seeing the opening title  introducing michael madsen   sue me  2  some of the dialogue is so bad that its classic  ill stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too  thats about it  to wrap it up  this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds  but hey  look  michael madsen   see also tilt  executive target  my bosss daughter  etc   now ive gotta rewatch reservoir dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him  see ya  kids   this stuffs gonna make me go blind  but im gonna drink it anyway    madsens first taste of cheap alcohol  i dont understand  everything seems so beautiful     madsen walking outside after confessing to god  im going downtown later and pick up a bible and im gonna get a haircut too    madsen after converting at the dinner table  because satan lives in your hair
"I was really, really disappointed with this movie. it started really well, and built up some great atmosphere and suspense, but when it finally got round to revealing the ""monster""...it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems......again. Whoop-de-do. Yet another nutjob movie...like we don't already have enough of them.<br /><br />To be fair, the ""creep"" is genuinely unsettling to look at, and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy, but I'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human, albeit a twisted, demented, freakish one. When I saw all the tell-tale rats early on I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat-monster hybrid thing...it was such a let down when the Creep was revealed.<br /><br />On top of this, some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense. (Spoiler) <br /><br />Why the hell does the Creep kill the security Guard? Whats the point, apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says ""HI I'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE!""? Its stupid, and only seems to happen to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help.<br /><br />what the hells he been eating down there? I got the impression he was effectively walled in, and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose...so has he been munching rats all that time, and if so why do they hang around him so much? Why is he so damn hard to kill? He's thin, malnourished and not exactly at peak performance...but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that .cripple the non-psycho characters in the film.<br /><br />The DVD commentary says we are intended to empathise with Creep, but I just find him loathsome. Its an effective enough movie, but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick.",0,i was really  really disappointed with this movie  it started really well  and built up some great atmosphere and suspense  but when it finally got round to revealing the  monster    it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems      again  whoop de do  yet another nutjob movie   like we dont already have enough of them  to be fair  the  creep  is genuinely unsettling to look at  and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy  but im sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human  albeit a twisted  demented  freakish one  when i saw all the tell tale rats early on i was hoping for some kind of freaky rat monster hybrid thing   it was such a let down when the creep was revealed  on top of this  some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense   spoiler   why the hell does the creep kill the security guard  whats the point  apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says  hi im a psycho and i live down here    its stupid  and only seems to happen to prevent franka potentes character from getting help  what the hells he been eating down there  i got the impression he was effectively walled in  and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose   so has he been munching rats all that time  and if so why do they hang around him so much  why is he so damn hard to kill  hes thin  malnourished and not exactly at peak performance   but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that  cripple the non psycho characters in the film  the dvd commentary says we are intended to empathise with creep  but i just find him loathsome  its an effective enough movie  but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick 
"Vivacious & irrepressible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unlooked-for happiness into the lives of a lonely old sister & brother on Prince Edward Island.<br /><br />Lucy Maud Montgomery's well-loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie. Excellent production values, a literate script and first class performances gives the story exactly the touch of quality it deserves.<br /><br />Taking her professional name from the character she portrayed, actress Anne Shirley is a joy as the red-headed fourteen-year-old orphan who completely alters the lives of her new guardians. Completely assured in her starring role, Miss Shirley is a delight, entertaining the viewer with Anne's boundless imagination, quick temper and not-so-secret sorrows.<br /><br />Playing the stern spinster who gives the girl a home, Helen Westley also completely commands her role; the viewer will enjoy seeing this sharp-tongued woman slowly unbend to Anne's affection and child-like innocence. Australian character actor O. P. Heggie gives one of his finest performances as Westley's shy, gentle brother who welcomes Anne into his heart from the moment he arrives to fetch her from the railroad station.<br /><br />Tom Brown most agreeably plays the schoolboy who quickly grabs Anne's attention. Sara Haden is appropriately prickly as a nosy neighbor. Charley Grapewin makes the most of his few moments as Avonlea's doctor.",1,vivacious   irrepressible  anne of green gables brings unlooked for happiness into the lives of a lonely old sister   brother on prince edward island  lucy maud montgomerys well loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie  excellent production values  a literate script and first class performances gives the story exactly the touch of quality it deserves  taking her professional name from the character she portrayed  actress anne shirley is a joy as the red headed fourteen year old orphan who completely alters the lives of her new guardians  completely assured in her starring role  miss shirley is a delight  entertaining the viewer with annes boundless imagination  quick temper and not so secret sorrows  playing the stern spinster who gives the girl a home  helen westley also completely commands her role  the viewer will enjoy seeing this sharp tongued woman slowly unbend to annes affection and child like innocence  australian character actor o  p  heggie gives one of his finest performances as westleys shy  gentle brother who welcomes anne into his heart from the moment he arrives to fetch her from the railroad station  tom brown most agreeably plays the schoolboy who quickly grabs annes attention  sara haden is appropriately prickly as a nosy neighbor  charley grapewin makes the most of his few moments as avonleas doctor 
"I really don't want to compare Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear to the classic 1962 Cape Fear film, but I can't help it. Not only am I a huge fan of the Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck starred Cape Fear, but when Scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film (Cady taking the keys out of the ignition, dog dying) and even using Bernard Herrmann's score throughout the entire film, he's not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as I can't help but think of the classic Cape Fear nearly every scene. When comparing Scorsese's version of Cape Fear to the classic version, the remake comes out destroyed by the classic; but even when taking the film by itself, it's still bad.<br /><br />Now Scorsese and screenwriter Wesley Strick didn't just remake the 1962 Cape Fear scene for scene, they tried to do things differently. Unfortunately this is one of the film's problems. Gone is the original crazy and animal-like Max Cady who is out for personal revenge, the Max Cady in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to ""save"" Sam Bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side (his words, not mine). Also gone is the stand-up and strong Sam Bowden seen in the classic Cape Fear film, the Sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy, Magoo, distrustful, and very unlikable. Even Mrs. Bowden is a completely different character - she's crazier than Max Cady is! The overall story has also been changed around - Sam didn't testify against Cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version, Sam is now Cady's ex-lawyer who Cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to ""save"" him.<br /><br />The overall story has been changed, and I don't hold too much against it, but the overall script is also weak all around. Other sub-plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture, they are also just poorly written. The film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you can't take the least bit seriously. These aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have, but they have some help in this department as well.<br /><br />Now the classic version of Cape Fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety. However, Scorsese is unable to do any of this in his Cape Fear, giving the film a cookie-cutter early 1990s look, no sense of danger, no suspenseful scenes, and little style (unless you count animating fire and the skyline style). Yeah, there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this Cape Fear bigger than the original, but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe.<br /><br />If all that wasn't enough, the acting isn't great either. Robert De Niro (being somehow nominated for an Academy Award for his performance) starts off alright as Max Cady, but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film. The opposite thing happens for Jessica Lange and her performance of Mrs. Bowden, going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end. As Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte stays the same throughout the whole film: beige. Juliette Lewis (who also reeled in an Academy Award nomination) is decent enough in her role as Danielle Bowden, but she's called upon to play a real stupid character and it's hard to really like what we see on screen from her.<br /><br />This film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes, and I can't figure out why. I wanted to like it; I really did - I mean, if there's going to be a remake of Cape Fear I'd rather like that one too - but I just couldn't. Containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original Cape Fear, I found Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear to be a very bad film indeed.

The term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them.",1,i remember this show from swedish television  i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief  i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed  although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 s and the political climate of the 70 s  when i think of it  this was a real sci fi  a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are  the term sci fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space ships in them 
"I went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next Clerks, but left feeling let down. The humor was weak and the characters fairly flat. That isn't to say it was all bad, the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material, but the director switched focus to the cliche'd ""save the Mom-and-Pop store from the evil corporation guy"". I felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot, he would have come out with a much more memorable movie. Now, to do the film justice, I am from the Rochester area and loved the way he portrayed Webster. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (of Clerks) homage here was giving props to his hometown. Webster, NY is to Checkout what Red Bank, NJ is to Clerks. The director wisely threw in a date at Nick Tahou's. Trust me, as far as things to do in Rochester, a garbage plate is at the top of the list. I was lucky enough to see this film at the Little in Rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them.",0,i went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next clerks  but left feeling let down  the humor was weak and the characters fairly flat  that isnt to say it was all bad  the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material  but the director switched focus to the cliched  save the mom and pop store from the evil corporation guy   i felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot  he would have come out with a much more memorable movie  now  to do the film justice  i am from the rochester area and loved the way he portrayed webster  in fact  the best kevin smith  of clerks  homage here was giving props to his hometown  webster  ny is to checkout what red bank  nj is to clerks  the director wisely threw in a date at nick tahous  trust me  as far as things to do in rochester  a garbage plate is at the top of the list  i was lucky enough to see this film at the little in rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them 
"When I saw this film on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently, it wasn't. I have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful from all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it. He breaks the seal and certain disasters happen. The water turns to blood, the oceans die out, the moon turns red, etc. <br /><br />The female character was annoying as well. A lot of the stuff she did didn't make sense. Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it. Coincidentally, it's the date she's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert* <br /><br />The two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to murder his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it.<br /><br />Here's what happens. The mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. She touches her child's head, transferring her soul into the child and then dies. Then, the apocalypse stops.<br /><br />Why does God all of a sudden have a change of heart? He gets furious when the Governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he's all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby? <br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie is pretty stupid. It's another religious end of the world propaganda piece. The acting from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everybody else is excellent. That's about all there is.<br /><br />I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Good acting with a lot of nonsense!",0,when i saw this film on fearnet  i thought it would be a scary movie  apparently  it wasnt  i have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site  fearnet is a site that shows scary horror movies  the acting is wonderful from all the actors  i hated the story  the story was stupid  the movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it  he breaks the seal and certain disasters happen  the water turns to blood  the oceans die out  the moon turns red  etc   the female character was annoying as well  a lot of the stuff she did didnt make sense  like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it  coincidentally  its the date shes expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means   spoiler alert   the two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that god told him to murder his parents and the end where demi moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it  heres what happens  the mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins  demi moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child  she touches her childs head  transferring her soul into the child and then dies  then  the apocalypse stops  why does god all of a sudden have a change of heart  he gets furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then hes all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby    end spoiler   the movie is pretty stupid  its another religious end of the world propaganda piece  the acting from demi moore and michael biehn and everybody else is excellent  thats about all there is  i give this movie 2 stars out of 10  good acting with a lot of nonsense 
"The British 'heritage film' industry is out of control. There's nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies? This film rips the guts out of Orwell's tough novel, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but no-one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty. Orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a bleak, grey, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers. But this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing, and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s London, in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight, and even the slums of Lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish-strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate-box world. Worst of all is the script's relentless bonhomie, ancient jokes, and clunking dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the film is packed with great actors. But it's all for nothing. This film made me so angry! Britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We employ bland nobodies to turn it into soft-centred, anodyne pap for people who want to feel that they are 'getting some culture' while they drink their Horlicks and quietly doze off.",0,the british heritage film industry is out of control  theres nothing wrong with filming classic novels  but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies  this film rips the guts out of orwells tough novel  turning it into a harmless  fluffy romantic comedy  aspidistra may not be orwells best work  but no one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty  orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger  but the humiliation of being poor  in the novel  london is a bleak  grey  cold  heartless city  and comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers  but this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing  and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s london  in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight  and even the slums of lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes  comstocks poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate box world  worst of all is the scripts relentless bonhomie  ancient jokes  and clunking dialogue  its so frustrating because richard e  grant is the perfect person to play gordon comstock  and the film is packed with great actors  but its all for nothing  this film made me so angry  britains literary history is something to be proud of for its richness  complexity and power  and what do we do with it  we employ bland nobodies to turn it into soft centred  anodyne pap for people who want to feel that they are getting some culture while they drink their horlicks and quietly doze off

"""Who Done It?"" contains many surefire laughs and gags. It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as ""Pardon My Terror."") It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />Old Man Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp, Larry, and Moe out of fear that he will be murdered. When they arrive at his home, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? <br /><br />Shemp is particularly funny in this film. His reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film. With his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he didn't tower over everyone else! ""Who Done It?"" is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.",1, who done it   contains many surefire laughs and gags  it is not only one of the best stooges films with shemp  it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced  director bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges  but when curly howard suffered a career ending stroke  it was tailored for the columbia comedy team of schilling and lane  their version was released as  pardon my terror    it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up  and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947  old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp  larry  and moe out of fear that he will be murdered  when they arrive at his home  goodrich has disappeared  and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges  will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice   shemp is particularly funny in this film  his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb  he gives his trademark sound  eeeb eeeb eeeb  and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh  other funny scenes  the close up of moes mug looking through the camera lens  and the in the dark fight with all cast members involved  nikko the goon  played by duke york  is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film  with his kinked hair  he could almost pass for a stooge  if he didnt tower over everyone else   who done it   is a gem among the stooges films with shemp  even die hard curly fans will enjoy this one  a true stooge classic  9 out of 10 
"The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. It should have read 'Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family's church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about God's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego'.<br /><br />It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?' moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. I believe I counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, 'prey'. Sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) as it became totally zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.<br /><br />For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as Jesus Camp, The God Who Wasn't There, What Would Jesus Buy, or the soon-to-be released Religulous.<br /><br />Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.",0,the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film  it should have read be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your familys church at 8 years old  listening to the preacher drone on about gods will while all you can think of is getting back home to your lego  it starts off well intentioned  building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as rennys how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast  moment  it then slowly morphs into a christian jamboree  sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic induced babble  i believe i counted the use of the word pray about 53 times in a five minute span near the end  after the 31st  i tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym  prey  sadly  this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes  plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say prayer  preyer to me  as it became totally zany  indeed  even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom  almost to the point of ending up on the floor  for all the salivating christians who ranked this film 8 10 stars  i suggest sticking with your theology reinforcing safety standards like circle square  the ten commandments  anything from narnia  jesus christ superstar and the like  stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp  the god who wasnt there  what would jesus buy  or the soon to be released religulous  maybe robert whitlows book is better 
"""Scoop"" is easily Woody Allen's funniest film of the 2000's so far. Allen, although finally looking his age, is at the top of his game as low-brow magician Sidney Waterman. His one-liners and demeanor are hilarious. Don't let the critics sway your opinion. ""Scoop"" is a top notch ""Woody-Lite"" picture. <br /><br />The classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen. Scarlett Johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit.

"While filming an 80's horror movie called 'Hot Blooded', the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer. After all of this, the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust. So a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they're warned by people to keep away from the film, as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film. From this it's labelled as a cursed production. Not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from Hollywood to reprise her role, but not as the daughter but the mother. But again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film's killer.<br /><br />Look what 'Scream' started! Hey, I enjoy those films, but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses. During this stage the sub-genre came back with vengeance, but it wasn't much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts, where they followed the derivative pattern of the Scream franchise. 'Cut' which is an independent Australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick. But you know what, I found it a cheesy delight. Yeah, It's gawd awful and highly forgettable, but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted. Although I did hate it when I originally came across it, but the second time around I knew what I was getting myself into and it worked better for it. It was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again, but this time it wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />The film came out around the same time as 'Scream 3' and 'Urban Legends: The Final Cut' did, which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie. 'Scream 3' is obviously the strongest of the three, but I would actually watch this trash over Urban Legends: The Final Cut. Though, it did seem more of a throwback to the 80's slashers than that of one of Scream's bastard offspring. Pretty much the film is given b-grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances. The dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense. While, the performances are pure mockery and Molly Ringwald takes the crown for it. She plays the wash-up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and I had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send-up performance. She provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly. The rest were mostly recognizable Australian TV stars (that's if you're an Australian) with a ravishing Jessica Napier leading the cast with the likes of Stephen Curry and Frank Roberts. Also pop singer (and supposed actress) Kylie Minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up! Nice. These teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim-witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed. Sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue, because they have no real substance to be there.<br /><br />The plot starts off rather interestingly, then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up, but then it makes a sudden u-turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre. Simply it's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness I was kind of left thinking oh my. This when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner, but sadly it falls along way. But don't you just love an opening ending. Also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential, tongue-in-cheek approach. Predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over-stated at times, but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit. The atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness, but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added 'some' spookiness. The cinema scene is done rather nicely too.<br /><br />Now, now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick, but sadly there's no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard, if lacking but it's more then decent for such low-budget flick. There are one or two creative deaths, but the rest are systematic. The killer wasn't bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it I thought, well the smart-ass attitude didn't sit well with me. Another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut-away editing, out-of-place soundtrack and Kimble Rendall's direction lacked execution and was pretty careless, but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness.<br /><br />The imagination matches the budget that's for sure, but heck this lousy slasher wasn't trying to be anything else.

"The film is a collection of cliche's on just about anything out there. It has no focus whatsoever, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous. This movie can't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists. Every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy, unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal. Where there is no substance to this exchange, the actors (regardless of how good they are normally) can't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion, aka ""raising the stakes"". Over acting, to put it simply. The directing is of no help here. Nothing can save this non-story. It is forced, faked and boring to tears. Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who, piercings and flashy 90's outfits. Characters wander without a role, detail and motive. Locations are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever, with meaning and art ripped out.<br /><br />Good DP. I'll give it that.<br /><br />Some films have flaws. This film is Lee's flaw. He sold out, like the rest of them. Became irrelevant. He has nothing of interest to say anymore.<br /><br />I have no desire to see anything again from this guy (whom I'll refrain from naming from now on).",0,the film is a collection of cliches on just about anything out there  it has no focus whatsoever  no goals  no real message  symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous  this movie cant resist the temptation of making drama where non exists  every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy  unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal  where there is no substance to this exchange  the actors  regardless of how good they are normally  cant help but compensate with exaggerated emotion  aka  raising the stakes   over acting  to put it simply  the directing is of no help here  nothing can save this non story  it is forced  faked and boring to tears  inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with the who  piercings and flashy 90s outfits  characters wander without a role  detail and motive  locations are arbitrary  this is boogie nights cum the good fellas cum saturday night fever  with meaning and art ripped out  good dp  ill give it that  some films have flaws  this film is lees flaw  he sold out  like the rest of them  became irrelevant  he has nothing of interest to say anymore  i have no desire to see anything again from this guy  whom ill refrain from naming from now on

"Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.<br /><br />The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors. The production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch. Reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.<br /><br />In one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off. Geez, hard to believe but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting "" None Shall Pass"" and "" It's only a flesh wound, I've had worse"". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year.<br /><br />The ""gladiator/demon"" was a stitch too. Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.<br /><br />Truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable.

"The worlds largest inside joke. The world's largest, most exclusive inside joke.<br /><br />Emulating the brash and 'everyman' humor of office space, this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books. The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary, and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist.<br /><br />The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time, listening to music and writing a novel while working. These are his goals. You can't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when (around halfway through) they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria, but then gives it UP! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the audience's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof.<br /><br />Apart from that major stumbling block, the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen. Without these asides, the audience wouldn't have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if it doesn't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny.",0,the worlds largest inside joke  the worlds largest  most exclusive inside joke  emulating the brash and everyman humor of office space  this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books  the audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary  and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist  the entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time  listening to music and writing a novel while working  these are his goals  you cant imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when  around halfway through  they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria  but then gives it up  the director and screenwriter  jacob kornbluth and josh kornbluth  completely remove the audiences motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof  apart from that major stumbling block  the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen  without these asides  the audience wouldnt have noticed anything particularly strange  humor is only effective if it doesnt need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny

"Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away. If you look fast you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation. Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.<br /><br />Secondly though, I actually knew a real life Arthur Bach. He was not quite as wealthy as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid. His parents tightly controlled his purse strings, but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just like Dudley Moore does. <br /><br />The wonder with Arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was a most charming person when you got to know him. In fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor. He spent his life being a perfect party guest. The term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him.<br /><br />And that's what Dudley Moore is, a wastrel. Unlike my friend Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him. That's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur. My friend also never found a Liza Minnelli, a male Liza Minnelli in fact because he was gay. Still Moore's portrayal of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so real for me.<br /><br />Arthur, 20th century wastrel, is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in Jill Eikenberry. Since he won't work for a living, the threat of being cut off is quite real for him. He only has his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and chauffeur Bitterman played by Ted Post to pour his troubles out to. We should all have such troubles.<br /><br />John Gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances. Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at Oscar time. The Academy gave Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor Award essentially for the work of a lifetime. That man was amazing, still at his craft almost to the end.<br /><br />So to Frank Graham who worked in the film and to Jackie Weiss, a genuine real life Arthur, I dedicate this review.",1,arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons  a good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away  if you look fast you can see frank graham during the restaurant scene in the background while dudley moore and jill eikenberry are in conversation  frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him  secondly though  i actually knew a real life arthur bach  he was not quite as wealthy as arthur  but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid  his parents tightly controlled his purse strings  but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in greenwich village  he spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself  just like dudley moore does   the wonder with arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not  but thats the other half of the equation  my friend was a most charming person when you got to know him  in fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming  he couldnt buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor  he spent his life being a perfect party guest  the term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him  and thats what dudley moore is  a wastrel  unlike my friend moore has john gielgud to clean up after him  thats a full time job as we see demonstrated in arthur  my friend also never found a liza minnelli  a male liza minnelli in fact because he was gay  still moores portrayal of arthur bach is deadly accurate and so real for me  arthur  20th century wastrel  is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in jill eikenberry  since he wont work for a living  the threat of being cut off is quite real for him  he only has his butler hobson played by john gielgud and chauffeur bitterman played by ted post to pour his troubles out to  we should all have such troubles  john gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in arthur on film and in fact gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances  yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at oscar time  the academy gave henry fonda and katharine hepburn oscars for on golden pond and gielgud the best supporting actor award essentially for the work of a lifetime  that man was amazing  still at his craft almost to the end  so to frank graham who worked in the film and to jackie weiss  a genuine real life arthur  i dedicate this review 
"A shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern British films, one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that American films are judged. Britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it, but at warmth British films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor.<br /><br />This film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor, so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers. It's a couple of decades later, Gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind. He teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses. When students he's fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he's just all talk.<br /><br />This is a subversive film in that there's not the usual worldly character of any American movie that you expect to do whatever he does, but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles. Maybe. It's certainly no protest-by-numbers though, being too warm. Where U.S. film may seem realistic because they're urban and gritty, this and other British films of recent years - those that don't try to match America for visceral thrills - are real because British humour reveals truths.",1,a shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern british films  one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that american films are judged  britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it  but at warmth british films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor  this film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor  so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers  its a couple of decades later  gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind  he teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses  when students hes fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether hes just all talk  this is a subversive film in that theres not the usual worldly character of any american movie that you expect to do whatever he does  but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles  maybe  its certainly no protest by numbers though  being too warm  where u s  film may seem realistic because theyre urban and gritty  this and other british films of recent years   those that dont try to match america for visceral thrills   are real because british humour reveals truths 
"I have nothing against a fast-paced fright-flick, but this Stephen King-derived nonsense is too freshly-scrubbed, too bright and modern. The plot, about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a ""Sleepwalker""--sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf--and who feeds on the blood of female virgins, begs for a more mysterious, ambiguous treatment. This thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel, with hardly any atmosphere. The kids are predictably pretty and energetic, but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, from ""Ghost Story"", never broke out of the filler-female mold, and it's a huge loss that she hasn't been used more. Her performance is creepy and intense, and gives hint that ""Sleepwalkers"" might've been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction. It's too over-the-top and commercially-driven, with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama. Stephen King pops up in a cameo, as do real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. *1/2 from ****",0,i have nothing against a fast paced fright flick  but this stephen king derived nonsense is too freshly scrubbed  too bright and modern  the plot  about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a  sleepwalker   sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf  and who feeds on the blood of female virgins  begs for a more mysterious  ambiguous treatment  this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel  with hardly any atmosphere  the kids are predictably pretty and energetic  but the big plus is alice kridge as the boys mother  kridge  from  ghost story   never broke out of the filler female mold  and its a huge loss that she hasnt been used more  her performance is creepy and intense  and gives hint that  sleepwalkers  mightve been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction  its too over the top and commercially driven  with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama  stephen king pops up in a cameo  as do real life directors john landis and tobe hooper   1 2 from     
"I love John Saxon in anything he's in. The one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled ""Please Do Not Watch This Movie Called: Zombie Death House"". The $1000 dollar Shock Insurance Certificate is dear Fred Olen Ray's tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70's cheese legend. Ray being the front man at RetroMedia. Ray by the way makes Charles Band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon. Just plain bad now, the both of them- and boring besides. It's great that Ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it's public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word ""Zombie"" sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of F.O.R.)

"OK, so I rented this clown-like-Chainsaw-Massacre-esquire film, not expected much, but I did like the novel approach to a serial killer film. (from the back of the box is the following synopsis) ""At first, it was just a joke - a myth around the campfire - for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the Texas woods. But when they began to disappear one-by-one, replaced by scattered, bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies, the remaining few scramble for their lives. But he's out there. And he's sick. And all he wants is blood..."" So obviously from the get-go it doesn't make sense: why is this clown in the woods to begin with? Why a clown? Why are their dolls with the word ""food"" drawn on them? Why why why? Hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min. bore fest except where this clown lives. The characters are dumb guys, dumb girls, and a hell of a lot of bitchiness. One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew. What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin? She, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear.<br /><br />The music was an average affair (standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences). The actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything. The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him. There was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $1-store dolls lying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie (been done too many times). I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film (in through the glass maybe), but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film. I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something.<br /><br />I had to give the film a 3. It was an interesting premise (clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, essentially) and I'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a B-movie-style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video. But ultimately, I probably would've felt like renting the Killer Klowns from Mars video again before going back to check this out.

"This was a very entertaining movie and I really enjoyed it, I don't normally rent movies like these (ie. indie flicks) however, I was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included Jamie Kennedy, whom I have loved since the Scream trilogy. The movie director took a risk (and it is a risky risk) in telling the lives of many (and I mean MANY) different people and having the intertwine at various intervals. Taking that risk was a good idea because it's end result is an exceedingly good film. <br /><br />The film has a few MAIN characters; Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) - a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) - an airplane loader/technician who has a love for all living things (except, perhaps meter maids) and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck. Cyr (Brian Cox) - the owner of a Chinese restaurant/donut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistant/cook Sung -(Alexis Cruz) under pressure to keep up with his phobia. Ernie - (Christopher Bauer) is married to Olive - (Christina Kirk) who he is convinced is trying to; stop him have fun, look ridiculous, go insane, and not live a normal life. They begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and Olive seriously begins to have doubts about Ernie. Gordon - (Grant Heslov) is a man whose life isn't going very well, as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand. Mitchel - (Jon Huertas) is convinced that Gwen - (Alexandra Westcourt) is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other, though she is more skeptical. He attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts! Johnston - (Michael Hitchcock) has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider, he takes another job that he just isn't suited for. His wife Annelle - (Arabella Field) is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that Johnston wasn't quite the loving husband she thought he was.<br /><br />All in all I definitely suggest this movie!<br /><br />-Erica",1,this was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed it  i dont normally rent movies like these  ie  indie flicks  however  i was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included jamie kennedy  whom i have loved since the scream trilogy  the movie director took a risk  and it is a risky risk  in telling the lives of many  and i mean many  different people and having the intertwine at various intervals  taking that risk was a good idea because its end result is an exceedingly good film   the film has a few main characters  dwight  jamie kennedy    a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument  wallace gregory  john carroll lynch    an airplane loader technician who has a love for all living things  except  perhaps meter maids  and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck  cyr  brian cox    the owner of a chinese restaurant donut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistant cook sung   alexis cruz  under pressure to keep up with his phobia  ernie    christopher bauer  is married to olive    christina kirk  who he is convinced is trying to  stop him have fun  look ridiculous  go insane  and not live a normal life  they begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and olive seriously begins to have doubts about ernie  gordon    grant heslov  is a man whose life isnt going very well  as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand  mitchel    jon huertas  is convinced that gwen    alexandra westcourt  is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other  though she is more skeptical  he attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts  johnston    michael hitchcock  has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider  he takes another job that he just isnt suited for  his wife annelle    arabella field  is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that johnston wasnt quite the loving husband she thought he was  all in all i definitely suggest this movie   erica
"This ensemble piece about adults who return to the formulative Summer camp of their youth was a very quiet entrant and exiter to the cinemas in the Autumn of 1993. I'd say that was a shame,but then again,some of the better movies ARE quiet releases that don't get much hype or praise.<br /><br />Diane LAne,Kevin Pollack,Elizabeth Perkins,Vincent Spano,Julie Warner,Bill Paxton,Kimberly Williams,Matt Craven and Alan Arkin(who is painfully good here) are the group of actors who flesh out these roles as people who have grown old with good,bad and funny memories of summers gone past. This film covers the gambit of emotions,mostly pleasant,and the film never hammers away at the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling,preferring to allow the viewer to enter into the memories on their own. Since I am a movie viewer who bristles at bluntly,brazen manipulation in films,this is something that I appreciate from writer/director Mike Binder.<br /><br />This film's a great cheap rent,a good main rent and even a pretty sit in a theater flick. You might run across this on TV,and I would definitely suggest a look-see.",1,this ensemble piece about adults who return to the formulative summer camp of their youth was a very quiet entrant and exiter to the cinemas in the autumn of 1993  id say that was a shame but then again some of the better movies are quiet releases that dont get much hype or praise  diane lane kevin pollack elizabeth perkins vincent spano julie warner bill paxton kimberly williams matt craven and alan arkin who is painfully good here  are the group of actors who flesh out these roles as people who have grown old with good bad and funny memories of summers gone past  this film covers the gambit of emotions mostly pleasant and the film never hammers away at the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling preferring to allow the viewer to enter into the memories on their own  since i am a movie viewer who bristles at bluntly brazen manipulation in films this is something that i appreciate from writer director mike binder  this films a great cheap rent a good main rent and even a pretty sit in a theater flick  you might run across this on tv and i would definitely suggest a look see 
"Luckily, not knowing anything about this movie I was curious enough to tape it from TV. And then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!<br /><br />But I'm glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. Considering the production year 1969, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. And it's not just because of the two George's actresses.<br /><br />The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, And it certainly did hit me. Very effective. Also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. Well, being a case of war, mostly bad.<br /><br />For the fans of composer Ennio Morricone this is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching but never over the top. And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fräulein! Let's hope they get this on DVD soon, so I can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem.",1,luckily  not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv  and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending  but im glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie  there are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots  but also very chilling and even daring moments  considering the production year 1969  the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows  of course now it doesnt surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done  and its not just because of the two georges actresses  the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly  no wonder  and it certainly did hit me  very effective  also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action  this is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side  but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad  well  being a case of war  mostly bad  for the fans of composer ennio morricone this is also a must  his work is always excellent  touching but never over the top  and i think i have to try to catch more movies with suzy kendall  talk about fräulein  lets hope they get this on dvd soon  so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem 
"I wait for each new episode, each re-run with anticipation! The new look of sci-fi created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder that I hope will never end. To combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me. Season #9 should be a thrill in itself. I wish that Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season, as I love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. You cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake. Also, you need a bigger role for the Asgard - they are just too cool.",1,i wait for each new episode  each re run with anticipation  the new look of sci fi created by stargate sg 1 is a wonder that i hope will never end  to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me  season  9 should be a thrill in itself  i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season  as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack oneill  the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner  season after season  you cancel this program in the next three years  and you make a serious mistake  also  you need a bigger role for the asgard   they are just too cool 
"I have been a fan of this movie for years and years. Because of Teri Hatchers move into the forefront, I had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it. Why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. Although I never have watching daytime soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch it. The acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart. I highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already. You will get to see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, and Carrie Fisher...to name a few...all give splendid performances.",1,i have been a fan of this movie for years and years  because of teri hatchers move into the forefront  i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it  why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me  sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous  although i never have watching daytime soap operas  this movie kills me every time i watch it  the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart  i highly recommend that you watch this if you havent already  you will get to see elizabeth shue  whoopi goldberg  teri hatcher  and carrie fisher   to name a few   all give splendid performances 
"I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one. **MILD SPOILERS** Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse? The poor of London coming out to sing? Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset? Not exactly faithful to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison. **END OF SPOILERS**<br /><br />Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing little more than growling to indicate his evil. Worst however, is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he's really the main character. His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl. Guess they didn't realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in England.<br /><br />Self-respecting Dickens fans: stick to David Lean's amazing 1948 film or the BBC 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80's.

"We all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust. Maybe that's a bit hastey but damn if ""Slaughter High"" wasn't terribly unoriginal, even for a slasher flick. Pretty much, the plot involves a kid who experienced a Carrie-like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former-bullies who all show up to reminisce. As you'd expect, they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on April 1st by means of electrocution, burning, hanging, and chemically altered beer. I've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie, but considering the ending, I feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time.

"""Show People"" is an absolutely delightful silent directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying to make it on the big screen. Though she's a success in comedy, what she wants to do is make ""art"" so she moves up to High Arts Studio. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend Billy.<br /><br />Many stars of the silent era have cameos in ""Show People,"" including Davies herself without the curly hair and makeup. I'm sure when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; sadly, nowadays, it's not the case, even for film buffs. In one part of the film, however, she does meet Charlie Chaplin; in another, author Elinor Glyn is pointed out to her, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other stars who pop up in ""Show People"" are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S.

"Brilliant actor as he is, Al Pacino completely derails Revolution  his Method acting approach is totally ill-suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the American War of Independence. Much of the blame should be attributed to director Hugh Hudson (yes, the man who made Chariots Of Fire just a couple of years earlier  talk about a come-down!!). One of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors, coaxing believable performances from them, but in this case Hudson has allowed Pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind. It's not just Al's career-low performance that hinders the film though: there are numerous other flaws with Revolution, more of which will be said later.<br /><br />Illiterate trapper Tom Dobb (Al Pacino) lives in the north-eastern region of America with his son Ned (Sid Owen/Dexter Fletcher). He leads a simple life  living off the land, raising his son, surviving against the elements. The country is lorded over by the English colonialists, but during an eight year period (1775-83) a revolution takes place which ends with the British being defeated and the independent American nation being born. Dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the Continental Army  swept away by events they can barely understand, the Dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another. Tom also falls in love with Daisy McConnahay (Natassja Kinski), a beautiful and fiery woman of British aristocratic ancestry. Their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.<br /><br />Where to start with the film's flaws? Most key actors are miscast  Pacino has been criticised enough already, but Kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while Donald Sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless English soldier with a wobbly Yorkshire accent. Robert Dillon's script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level. At no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the American Revolution as a backdrop, or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along. As a result, the narrative falls into no man's land, flitting from ""grand spectacle"" to ""small story"" indiscriminately and meaninglessly. John Corigliano's score is quite ghastly, and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety. Hugh Hudson's direction is clumsy throughout, both in his mismanagement of Pacino and the other key actors, and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences. The idea of the hand-held camera is to create immediacy  that feeling of ""being there"" in the confusion of battle and musket fire. Like so many other things in the film, it doesn't work. The one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail, with costumes, sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate. But if it's period detail you're interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time, because as a rousing cinematic experience Revolution doesn't even begin to make the grade. Nothing more than a £18,000,000 mega-bomb that the ailing British film industry could ill afford in the mid-1980s.",0,brilliant actor as he is  al pacino completely derails revolution  his method acting approach is totally ill suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the american war of independence  much of the blame should be attributed to director hugh hudson  yes  the man who made chariots of fire just a couple of years earlier  talk about a come down     one of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors  coaxing believable performances from them  but in this case hudson has allowed pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind  its not just als career low performance that hinders the film though  there are numerous other flaws with revolution  more of which will be said later  illiterate trapper tom dobb  al pacino  lives in the north eastern region of america with his son ned  sid owen dexter fletcher   he leads a simple life  living off the land  raising his son  surviving against the elements  the country is lorded over by the english colonialists  but during an eight year period  1775 83  a revolution takes place which ends with the british being defeated and the independent american nation being born  dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the continental army  swept away by events they can barely understand  the dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another  tom also falls in love with daisy mcconnahay  natassja kinski   a beautiful and fiery woman of british aristocratic ancestry  their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting  where to start with the films flaws  most key actors are miscast  pacino has been criticised enough already  but kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while donald sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless english soldier with a wobbly yorkshire accent  robert dillons script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level  at no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the american revolution as a backdrop  or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along  as a result  the narrative falls into no mans land  flitting from  grand spectacle  to  small story  indiscriminately and meaninglessly  john coriglianos score is quite ghastly  and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety  hugh hudsons direction is clumsy throughout  both in his mismanagement of pacino and the other key actors  and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences  the idea of the hand held camera is to create immediacy  that feeling of  being there  in the confusion of battle and musket fire  like so many other things in the film  it doesnt work  the one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail  with costumes  sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate  but if its period detail youre interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time  because as a rousing cinematic experience revolution doesnt even begin to make the grade  nothing more than a £18 000 000 mega bomb that the ailing british film industry could ill afford in the mid 1980s 
"I've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as I was by Ali McGraw's in this movie. God is she bothersome or what?! She says everything in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible in fact that, by contrast, Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /><br />There is not much of a story. He's rich, she's wooden, they both have to Sacrifice A Lot for Love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, hers is called by his first name, in case you didn't notice the Difference in The Two of Them that They Overcame in the Name of Love. <br /><br />The Oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year. John Marley is fine as Wooden's father, but a Supporting Nomination? At least Ali didn't win. <br /><br />I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but then again, if it were up to me, Katharine Ross would have been in a lot more movies. She's certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /><br />I didn't even cry when she got sick, never occured to me to even feel sad. <br /><br />It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones looking like he was about 15, and the score is good. But this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long, and the sin of that is its not that old, but it feels it.",0,ive rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as i was by ali mcgraws in this movie  god is she bothersome or what   she says everything in the same tone and is horrible  so horrible in fact that  by contrast  ryan oneal is brilliant   there is not much of a story  hes rich  shes wooden  they both have to sacrifice a lot for love  his father is stonewall jackson  hers is called by his first name  in case you didnt notice the difference in the two of them that they overcame in the name of love   the oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year  john marley is fine as woodens father  but a supporting nomination  at least ali didnt win   i still think katharine ross should have played jennifer  but then again  if it were up to me  katharine ross would have been in a lot more movies  shes certainly a better actress than mcgraw   i didnt even cry when she got sick  never occured to me to even feel sad   it was nice to see tommy lee jones looking like he was about 15  and the score is good  but this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long  and the sin of that is its not that old  but it feels it 
"In the hands of lesser actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film could have become silly and trite. But, with these two experienced thespians leading the way, I found ""Silent Fury"" to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married, and that he was best man at that wedding, one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work. As Colbert, Ryan, and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage, they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed. Although it's not very difficult to figure out just who the main ""baddie"" is, it's still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases. All in all, a good, solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated Paul Kelly.",1,in the hands of lesser actors than claudette colbert and robert ryan this film could have become silly and trite  but  with these two experienced thespians leading the way  i found  silent fury  to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery  when their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that colbert is already married  and that he was best man at that wedding  one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work  as colbert  ryan  and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage  they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed  although its not very difficult to figure out just who the main  baddie  is  its still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases  all in all  a good  solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated paul kelly 
"Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the ""psycho""-like music at the wedding fight), but the acting overcomes it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But he develops well into a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. The end is fairly corny, though. I wont give it away, but it could be improved.

"I rented the dubbed-English version of Lensman, hoping that since it came from well-known novels it would have some substance. While there were hints of substance in the movie, it mostly didn't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or maybe even the source novels were lightweight. But for whatever reason, there wasn't much there.<br /><br />I noticed lots of details that were derivative, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise deficient. Some examples: The opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 ""star gate"" scene and the Star Wars image of hyperspace. The robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized ""R2-D2"".<br /><br />It starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of Star Wars, but mercifully (since the humor doesn't work) gives up on comedy and plays it serious. In that sense, it's superior to the Star Wars franchise, which started with a clever sense of humor, and eventually deteriorated to Jar-Jar's annoying silliness.<br /><br />The agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. The harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field, dumping silage onto unharvested crops, rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already-harvested rows or into a truck. Corn (maize) was pouring out the grain chute, but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field.<br /><br />When it was time for Kim's father had to face his fate, there wasn't any dramatic weight to the scene. That could have been partly the fault of the English-language voice actor, but the drawings didn't show much weight either. Kim's reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing.<br /><br />Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, even though they were apparently supposed to have been close. (Henderson's death is no spoiler; his name isn't revealed until his death scene.) She seems to promptly forget him. Someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does. I think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case; there's at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of Chris.<br /><br />On several occasions, villains fail to accomplish their orders. A villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths. I can't say whether that's lifted from Star Wars, or if that comes from an earlier source -- possibly the Lensman books.<br /><br />There's a scene where a space ship crash-lands. As it plunges toward the ground, parts are break off the ship. But so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands.<br /><br />While in most cases Chris seems like a competent, tough space hero, there's a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress. Someone tough enough to get over Henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to shout, ""help, it's got me and I can't reach my gun!"" instead of just shrieking.<br /><br />The character with the most personality (almost too much at times) is D.J. Bill. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, the D.J. in American Graffiti. I wonder if he's as well-voiced in the original language.<br /><br />Two planets in the movie exploded. The explosions were unimpressive, and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to Star Wars. To its credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the Death Star's primary weapon. The dialog had a good, interesting explanation for the cause. Many other explosions in the movie did look good, just not the planetary explosions.<br /><br />Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game. Some of the images look like primitive video games, and some influence from Tron is visible too. On the other hand, the sound effects are often pretty decent, although that emphasizes the cheesy-sounding parts. The art is good too, particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy-looking computer graphics.<br /><br />Finally, there's the story. If a movie tells a good story, it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings. But the plot here was pretty lightweight. A naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship, and acquires a great power he doesn't understand. He and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful, unredeemably evil enemy. He makes friends, learns about his special power, and grows into a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous enough, he might even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline, but there's very little more than that in this movie.<br /><br />In the end, it's just a kiddie cartoon. But then, since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children, maybe it doesn't need to be anything more than that.",0,i rented the dubbed english version of lensman  hoping that since it came from well known novels it would have some substance  while there were hints of substance in the movie  it mostly didnt rise above the level of kiddie cartoon  maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book  or it lost a lot in the dubbed version  or maybe even the source novels were lightweight  but for whatever reason  there wasnt much there  i noticed lots of details that were derivative  sloppy  poorly dramatized  or otherwise deficient  some examples  the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001  star gate  scene and the star wars image of hyperspace  the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized  r2 d2   it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars  but mercifully  since the humor doesnt work  gives up on comedy and plays it serious  in that sense  its superior to the star wars franchise  which started with a clever sense of humor  and eventually deteriorated to jar jars annoying silliness  the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm  the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field  dumping silage onto unharvested crops  rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already harvested rows or into a truck  corn  maize  was pouring out the grain chute  but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field  when it was time for kims father had to face his fate  there wasnt any dramatic weight to the scene  that could have been partly the fault of the english language voice actor  but the drawings didnt show much weight either  kims reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing  similarly  when a character named henderson was killed  chris showed very little reaction  even though they were apparently supposed to have been close   hendersons death is no spoiler  his name isnt revealed until his death scene   she seems to promptly forget him  someones expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does  i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case  theres at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris  on several occasions  villains fail to accomplish their orders  a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths  i cant say whether thats lifted from star wars  or if that comes from an earlier source    possibly the lensman books  theres a scene where a space ship crash lands  as it plunges toward the ground  parts are break off the ship  but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands  while in most cases chris seems like a competent  tough space hero  theres a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress  someone tough enough to get over hendersons death so quickly should at least be able to shout   help  its got me and i cant reach my gun   instead of just shrieking  the character with the most personality  almost too much at times  is d j  bill  he sounded like wolfman jack  the d j  in american graffiti  i wonder if hes as well voiced in the original language  two planets in the movie exploded  the explosions were unimpressive  and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars  to its credit  however  the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death stars primary weapon  the dialog had a good  interesting explanation for the cause  many other explosions in the movie did look good  just not the planetary explosions  some of the sound effects are very cheesy  as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game  some of the images look like primitive video games  and some influence from tron is visible too  on the other hand  the sound effects are often pretty decent  although that emphasizes the cheesy sounding parts  the art is good too  particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy looking computer graphics  finally  theres the story  if a movie tells a good story  it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings  but the plot here was pretty lightweight  a naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship  and acquires a great power he doesnt understand  he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful  unredeemably evil enemy  he makes friends  learns about his special power  and grows into a young man  if he is persistent and virtuous enough  he might even defeat the evil enemy  details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline  but theres very little more than that in this movie  in the end  its just a kiddie cartoon  but then  since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children  maybe it doesnt need to be anything more than that 
"This film is absolutely stunning. A new Blade Runner - future noir at it's most gritty. The vision of Paris is superb, both recognisable and visionary, with sweeping vistas, grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality.<br /><br />The story line is quite simple, with few surprises, but that's not what I like most about the film. It is a visual treat. <br /><br />Done in 3D and rendered in black and white (no greys!) with only one short spot of colour, it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds. There are many ""arty"" camera shots - closeups and odd viewpoints - but that just adds to the temperament of the film. Overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form.<br /><br />I was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped, such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions. But unlike ""A Scanner Darkly"" - which suffers from (or indeed is enhanced by) inconsistent character definition (just watch the way some of the hair changes shape!) - Renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. When the character is in close-up, added details and texture can bee seen, but when in mid-shot or further away details are omitted, but not to the detriment of character definition.<br /><br />For me, the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one-off project. Such a shame, as I would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir storyline and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style.<br /><br />Oh, and the English dub is great too.<br /><br />All in all a great film and highly recommended.",1,this film is absolutely stunning  a new blade runner   future noir at its most gritty  the vision of paris is superb  both recognisable and visionary  with sweeping vistas  grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality  the story line is quite simple  with few surprises  but thats not what i like most about the film  it is a visual treat   done in 3d and rendered in black and white  no greys   with only one short spot of colour  it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds  there are many  arty  camera shots   closeups and odd viewpoints   but that just adds to the temperament of the film  overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form  i was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped  such was the level of animation and high detail in the characters facial expressions  but unlike  a scanner darkly    which suffers from  or indeed is enhanced by  inconsistent character definition  just watch the way some of the hair changes shape     renaissance is consistent and precise throughout  when the character is in close up  added details and texture can bee seen  but when in mid shot or further away details are omitted  but not to the detriment of character definition  for me  the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one off project  such a shame  as i would like to see more of this futuristic film noir storyline and especially in this cutting edge graphic style  oh  and the english dub is great too  all in all a great film and highly recommended

"I saw this movie during a Tolkien-themed Interim class during my sophomore year of college. I was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing, but they weren't within constant eyesight.<br /><br />Let's get it out of the way: the Peter Jackson 'Lord of the Rings' films do owe something to the Bakshi film. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for instance, the scene in which the Black Riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in Bakshi's film, shot by shot. You could call this plagiarism or homage, depending on your agenda. <br /><br />I'm sure the similarities don't stop there. I'm not going to do any research to find out what they are, because that would imply I have some mote of respect for this film. I'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around.<br /><br />This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I've decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- If I've left out anything else that offended me it's because I'm completely overwhelmed, confronted with a wealth of failure (and, at high points, mediocrity).<br /><br />*Due to heavy use of rotoscoping, Gandalf is no longer a gentle, wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom (whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film).<br /><br />*Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as 'Aruman' during the film, without explanation. He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason.<br /><br />*Sam is flat out hideous. The portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying. Yes, hobbits are small like children, but they are NOT children.<br /><br />*Merry and Pippin are never introduced--they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation. The film is filled with sloppy editing like this.<br /><br />*Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road. One of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back--which was not visible before--and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into ""la-la-la""s. AWFUL.<br /><br />*Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (no pants), complete with huge, square pilgrim belt buckle. He is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie--oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass.<br /><br />*The Black Riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil. They limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace. This is disturbing to be sure, but not frightening.<br /><br />*The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen (in which they stare at Frodo, who is on the other side on horseback) goes on forever, during which time the Riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and... do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound. It turns out to be more plodding than anything else.<br /><br />*Gimli the Dwarf is just as tall as Legolas the Elf. He's a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for that. He also looks like a bastardized David the Gnome. It's a crude but accurate description.<br /><br />*Boromir appears to have pilfered Elmer Fudd's golden Viking armor from that Bugs Bunny opera episode. He looks ridiculous.<br /><br />*Despite the similarity to Tolkien's illustration, the Balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film. It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers, and it's barely taller than Gandalf. ""Purists"" may prefer this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version any day.<br /><br />*The battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's film, but they ARE supposed to be fighting.<br /><br />*Treebeard makes a very short appearance, and I was sorry he bothered to show up at all. Watch the film, you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Alright, now for the GOOD parts of the film.<br /><br />*Some of the voice acting is pretty good. It isn't that Aragorn SOUNDS bad, he just looks kind of like the Jolly Green Giant.<br /><br />*Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal; like Tom Bombadil, she seems immune to the Ring's powers of temptation, and her voice actress isn't horrible either.<br /><br />*Boromir's death isn't as heart wrenching as in Jackson's portrayal of the same scene, but it's still appropriately dramatic (and more true to his death in the book, though I don't believe Jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did).<br /><br />*As my professor pointed out (between whispered threats), the orcs (mainly at Helm's Deep, if I'm correct) resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers, a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted.<br /><br />*While this isn't really a positive point about the film, Bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie, or so I've been told--the project was on a tight budget, and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups (who I'm sure hadn't read the books).<br /><br />Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude. I simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product. <br /><br />Overall, I cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs, unless you've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters, places and events. I'm sure somebody, somewhere, will pick a copy of this up in confusion; if you do, keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it.",0,i saw this movie during a tolkien themed interim class during my sophomore year of college  i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy  everyone else was laughing  but they werent within constant eyesight  lets get it out of the way  the peter jackson lord of the rings films do owe something to the bakshi film  in jacksons version of the fellowship of the ring  for instance  the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshis film  shot by shot  you could call this plagiarism or homage  depending on your agenda   im sure the similarities dont stop there  im not going to do any research to find out what they are  because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film  im sure others have outlined the similarities  look around  this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor  and many  many people died in the accident  ive decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion  if ive left out anything else that offended me its because im completely overwhelmed  confronted with a wealth of failure  and  at high points  mediocrity    due to heavy use of rotoscoping  gandalf is no longer a gentle  wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom  whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film    saruman the white is sometimes referred to as aruman during the film  without explanation  he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason   sam is flat out hideous  the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying  yes  hobbits are small like children  but they are not children   merry and pippin are never introduced  they simply appear during a scene change with a one sentence explanation  the film is filled with sloppy editing like this   frodo  sam  pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road  one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back  which was not visible before  and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into  la la la s  awful   aragorn  apparently  is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic  no pants   complete with huge  square pilgrim belt buckle  he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie  oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass   the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil  they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace  this is disturbing to be sure  but not frightening   the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen  in which they stare at frodo  who is on the other side on horseback  goes on forever  during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and    do nothing else  the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodos hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound  it turns out to be more plodding than anything else   gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf  hes a dwarf  there is simply no excuse for that  he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome  its a crude but accurate description   boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudds golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode  he looks ridiculous   despite the similarity to tolkiens illustration  the balrog is howl inducing and the least threatening villain in the entire film  it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers  and its barely taller than gandalf   purists  may prefer this balrog  but ill take jacksons version any day   the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing  almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments  im not asking for action packed scenes like those in jacksons film  but they are supposed to be fighting   treebeard makes a very short appearance  and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all  watch the film  youll see what i mean  alright  now for the good parts of the film   some of the voice acting is pretty good  it isnt that aragorn sounds bad  he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant   galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal  like tom bombadil  she seems immune to the rings powers of temptation  and her voice actress isnt horrible either   boromirs death isnt as heart wrenching as in jacksons portrayal of the same scene  but its still appropriately dramatic  and more true to his death in the book  though i dont believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did    as my professor pointed out  between whispered threats   the orcs  mainly at helms deep  if im correct  resemble the war ravaged corpses of soldiers  a political statement that works pretty well if you realize whats being attempted   while this isnt really a positive point about the film  bakshi cant be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie  or so ive been told  the project was on a tight budget  and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher ups  who im sure hadnt read the books   let me be clear  i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude  i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product   overall  i cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkiens classic trilogy even for laughs  unless youve already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters  places and events  im sure somebody  somewhere  will pick a copy of this up in confusion  if you do  keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it

"I heard a few friends one day saying that ""Scarface sucks... some idiot tried to make another Godfather set in the early 80s."" Now, I usualy listen to idiots/watch CNN so I decided I'd stay away from it. Then my mate handed me the DVD and said ""This is #1 with the pelicangs"", confused I tried it. This IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE. It's more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford (*cough2Fast2Furiouscough*) There is some humor though... i.e. the Pelicangs and the light 80s music. Still, whats better than Al Pacino wielding an m203?

"I usually like zombie movies, but this one was just plain bad.<br /><br />The good parts: Girl swimming topless with thong bottoms, Sonya Salomaa's topless, and Ona Grauer's boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran.<br /><br />The bad part: too much video cuts, too much Matrix slow motion (it drags the action), not enough blood and guts, bad acting, and no story.

"During the Civil War, there were many cases of divided loyalties; obviously, many occurred ""In the Border States"", where North met South by happenstance of geography. From the border, young father Owen Moore goes off to join the Union Army. Shortly, Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regimen, wanders onto the enemy's property, desperate for water; he finds a supply where the Unionist's young daughter Gladys Egan sits. When the Yankee soldiers track him down, Little Gladys innocently helps the Confederate hide. Later, when he returns to kill her father, the little girl's kindness is remembered. A sweet, small story from director D.W. Griffith. Location footage and humanity are lovingly displayed. <br /><br />**** In the Border States (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B.

"I saw this movie way back when it premiered.<br /><br />It was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed-out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands.<br /><br />Then suddenly these children, many of whom weren't even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out (they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances), but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard, began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons, sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy, left and right.<br /><br />This whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder, opened it to the child and said 'type the picture you see', then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator, a fold would fall down, revealing another different picture.<br /><br />So while the child may have seen a dog, the moderator saw something like a boat.<br /><br />Every time, every bloomin' time, the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed, never what the child was shown.<br /><br />So who was doing the typing? Never the child.<br /><br />This movie further took a disastrous turn with, as the Australia poster stated, the person who molested the child in the movie was IN the situation trying to help the child.<br /><br />Had Melissa Gilbert never put her son IN that place, he wouldn't have been molested, is what the movie says. He was better off under her supervision.<br /><br />If I turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead, do you think I'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that? Not likely! I think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out, that this movie was based on, they never accused someone within their operation as took place here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from Gilbert as the mother of an autistic, but other than that, the movie really didn't do much.<br /><br />The worst by far was the child typing at the end to Patty Duke, and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed, . . . . . ""we won!"" This child was molested. If you cut my leg off and I take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me, assault, whatever, then that is legal justice, but it doesn't bring my leg back.<br /><br />At best, in my condition, I will view it as a hollow victory.<br /><br />Whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation.<br /><br />A 'normal' child has enough to contend with from such an experience.<br /><br />It's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go 'we won' if that person is found guilty in court.<br /><br />Just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here.",0,i saw this movie way back when it premiered  it was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands  then suddenly these children  many of whom werent even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out  they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances   but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard  began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons  sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy  left and right  this whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder  opened it to the child and said type the picture you see  then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator  a fold would fall down  revealing another different picture  so while the child may have seen a dog  the moderator saw something like a boat  every time  every bloomin time  the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed  never what the child was shown  so who was doing the typing  never the child  this movie further took a disastrous turn with  as the australia poster stated  the person who molested the child in the movie was in the situation trying to help the child  had melissa gilbert never put her son in that place  he wouldnt have been molested  is what the movie says  he was better off under her supervision  if i turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead  do you think im going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that  not likely  i think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out  that this movie was based on  they never accused someone within their operation as took place here  unfortunately  i do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from gilbert as the mother of an autistic  but other than that  the movie really didnt do much  the worst by far was the child typing at the end to patty duke  and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed             we won   this child was molested  if you cut my leg off and i take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me  assault  whatever  then that is legal justice  but it doesnt bring my leg back  at best  in my condition  i will view it as a hollow victory  whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation  a normal child has enough to contend with from such an experience  its utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go we won if that person is found guilty in court  just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here 
"Geez, another Lifetime movie, but once again isn't exactly the worst movie in the world, but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it's pretty obvious who is responsible for what, and it's generally fairly predictable. Worse yet, some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing, and the viewer is left wondering ""Okay, how much am I supposed to care?"" One thing I did like is that the movie goes to show you that it's never THAT simple as ""the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad"", and sometimes it IS evil vs evil rather than good vs evil. Hadley didn't do what she did out of a sense of justice, she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family, AND to eliminate the competition. As for Alicia, it simply proves that a victim isn't always a good person. Some of them really do ""have it coming"", even if ""it"" was a painful, horrible death. ""The Burning Bed"" is a great example of this, but the difference is that the vile man in ""The Burning Bed"" got exactly what he deserved. But, did Alicia ""have it coming""? Some will say that she did, but others don't agree, and the law generally doesn't either.<br /><br />As for acting, it's a mixed bag. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others just came across as indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or simply not convincing. The music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy, especially if you like girl/girl action. The movie isn't badly shot at all, but given its glaring weaknesses, the strengths are in background, unfortunately.<br /><br />I've heard rumors of a sequel, but given the years, I doubt it'll happen. But, I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is as EVIL, conniving and horrible as people say, then I don't think she'll be thinking, ""YAY! I woke up from a coma! Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh! That's okay! I totally forgive her and want the charges dropped!"" No way Hadley would be in jail for long anyway, if she even does any time since no murder actually happened. <br /><br />Anyway, worth checking out at least once!",0,geez  another lifetime movie  but once again isnt exactly the worst movie in the world  but far from the best  i think the main problem is that its pretty obvious who is responsible for what  and its generally fairly predictable  worse yet  some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing  and the viewer is left wondering  okay  how much am i supposed to care   one thing i did like is that the movie goes to show you that its never that simple as  the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad   and sometimes it is evil vs evil rather than good vs evil  hadley didnt do what she did out of a sense of justice  she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family  and to eliminate the competition  as for alicia  it simply proves that a victim isnt always a good person  some of them really do  have it coming   even if  it  was a painful  horrible death   the burning bed  is a great example of this  but the difference is that the vile man in  the burning bed  got exactly what he deserved  but  did alicia  have it coming   some will say that she did  but others dont agree  and the law generally doesnt either  as for acting  its a mixed bag  some do a good job  like mia  but others just came across as indifferent to their roles  they were mostly wooden or simply not convincing  the music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy  especially if you like girl girl action  the movie isnt badly shot at all  but given its glaring weaknesses  the strengths are in background  unfortunately  ive heard rumors of a sequel  but given the years  i doubt itll happen  but  i wouldnt be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared  if alicia is as evil  conniving and horrible as people say  then i dont think shell be thinking   yay  i woke up from a coma  oh  hadley was responsible  oh  thats okay  i totally forgive her and want the charges dropped   no way hadley would be in jail for long anyway  if she even does any time since no murder actually happened   anyway  worth checking out at least once 
This movie was awful in the worst way: you just didn't care. You didn't care what happened in the plot; you didn't care about the characters. Everyone was devoid of heart. I ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because I simply didn't want to subject my mind to it any more. There is far too much sex in the film. Sex can be okay; it can even make the movie (hence Karma Sutra) but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Don't see this film.,0,this movie was awful in the worst way  you just didnt care  you didnt care what happened in the plot  you didnt care about the characters  everyone was devoid of heart  i ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because i simply didnt want to subject my mind to it any more  there is far too much sex in the film  sex can be okay  it can even make the movie  hence karma sutra  but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy  it was just ugly  dont see this film

"I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. I found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). Like others, I found this film to be an awful mix of ""real"" science and pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda. <br /><br />As a psychologist, I was especially offended by Candace Pert's contributions. True, I was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the ""consciousness"" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term (""consciousness"") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. It is an old Orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay ""Politics and the English Language."" To refer to ""consciousness"" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as ""based in science"" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slave-states ""democratic republics"" and Hitler when he called his party a ""socialist workers"" movement.<br /><br />I don't claim to really understand quantum physics. I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. Ah, but we Americans do love ""instant enlightenment,"" and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. If it ASKED questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).<br /><br />By the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several ""expert commentators"" with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), not to mention J.Z. Knight, who often speaks in her ""Ramtha"" voice. (I'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old Atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. But then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago, I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. Only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh, I forgot, I'm the creator of ""good"" and ""bad"" advice, so it's all my fault, not Ramtha's.)<br /><br />What a mess.",0,i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film  i found it incredibly silly  at best  and downright misleading  misinforming and harmful  at worst   like others  i found this film to be an awful mix of  real  science and pseudoscientific  new age propaganda   as a psychologist  i was especially offended by candace perts contributions  true  i was not a fan of hers before this film  but her discourse on the  consciousness  of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term   consciousness   that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify  it is an old orwellian mind f  k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay  politics and the english language   to refer to  consciousness  in this manner  indeed  to refer to this film as  based in science  in general  which is its clear intent   is to use language in the same manner employed by stalin when he labeled his slave states  democratic republics  and hitler when he called his party a  socialist workers  movement  i dont claim to really understand quantum physics  i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study  ah  but we americans do love  instant enlightenment   and thats what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish  if it asked questions  that would be one thing  but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them  which no film could possibly do simply because we are far  far away from the answers  if they indeed exist   by the way  ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several  expert commentators  with the maharishi mahesh yogi  and tm   not to mention j z  knight  who often speaks in her  ramtha  voice   im always amazed at this channeled 10 000 year old atlantean supermans grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology  but then again  this film argues that the past  present and future are all one and the same  so if ramtha existed in atlantis 10 000 years ago  i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow  only  then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers  oh  i forgot  im the creator of  good  and  bad  advice  so its all my fault  not ramthas   what a mess

Watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching. Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming. And seeing him smile was indescribable.

"This is one of the weirder movies I have recently watched. That's because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film. Kurasawa's experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences. Not every episode is depressing and harsh, but overall this is definitely the tone. Let's see,...we have a case of incest/rape, attempted murder, wife swapping, alcoholism, infidelity, death of a little boy after eating tainted fish, a man with severe depression (he never talks during the movie and looks very scary), a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments ""driving"" his street car through paths among the garbage piles, a man married to a total shrew (I think I liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist!), etc., etc. In fact, it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an Ingmar Bergman movie set in Japan, as Bergman made MANY movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life. Is it any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself?! So, did I like it? No. It was not a fun experience. But, it was a very well-made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was sort of like watching a train wreck--you don't WANT to see all the carnage but you can't help but watch! Of all the vignettes, I think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didn't really seem to fit in (he was too well-adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump) was perhaps meant to represent Kurasawa himself. Maybe. I dunno.<br /><br />If you've seen a variety of Kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films, give this one a watch. However, do NOT make this your first experience watching his movies--it's sure to scare away many viewers!",1,this is one of the weirder movies i have recently watched  thats because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film  kurasawas experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences  not every episode is depressing and harsh  but overall this is definitely the tone  lets see    we have a case of incest rape  attempted murder  wife swapping  alcoholism  infidelity  death of a little boy after eating tainted fish  a man with severe depression  he never talks during the movie and looks very scary   a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia  a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments  driving  his street car through paths among the garbage piles  a man married to a total shrew  i think i liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist    etc   etc  in fact  it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an ingmar bergman movie set in japan  as bergman made many movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life  is it any wonder that after making this film kurasawa tried to kill himself   so  did i like it  no  it was not a fun experience  but  it was a very well made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result  i really wanted to see what happened to these people  it was sort of like watching a train wreck  you dont want to see all the carnage but you cant help but watch  of all the vignettes  i think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didnt really seem to fit in  he was too well adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump  was perhaps meant to represent kurasawa himself  maybe  i dunno  if youve seen a variety of kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films  give this one a watch  however  do not make this your first experience watching his movies  its sure to scare away many viewers 
"This isn't the best Bigfoot ever made, but by the recent standards of Nature gone awry movies, mostly showing on the Sci-Fi channel, this is quality stuff. It has some action, some humor, decent F/X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but so are some practical F/X, which I like.<br /><br />Overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of B horror/sci-fi and need a fix. It's better than the movie Sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don't be fooled.<br /><br />The acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate. Expect a bit of a lul as the characters are ""developed"", but know that things will pick up. If you are watching a DVD you may want to skip a chapter or two.",1,this isnt the best bigfoot ever made  but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies  mostly showing on the sci fi channel  this is quality stuff  it has some action  some humor  decent f x and bigfoot  cg is used  but so are some practical f x  which i like  overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of b horror sci fi and need a fix  its better than the movie sasquatch and not a sequel to it  so dont be fooled  the acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate  expect a bit of a lul as the characters are  developed   but know that things will pick up  if you are watching a dvd you may want to skip a chapter or two 
"Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not just for Debra Winger's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.<br /><br />There are surreal touches (the fire brigade that act like a singing Greek chorus), but there is also humour and romance. The soundtrack is great similar to the way American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting his own trailer a rockin' to 'She's a lady' ~ priceless ;)<br /><br />Best line missing from the quotes section btw ~ 'Once you've had a clown, you never go back!'<br /><br />I love this movie (I ordered the DVD from the US) and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with Legally Blond 3 don't put you off ~ give it a try :)",1,brothers with psychokinetic powers  yes  really  duel not just for debra wingers affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers  there are surreal touches  the fire brigade that act like a singing greek chorus   but there is also humour and romance  the soundtrack is great similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get   but with fire   and i dont think ill ever forget dennis quaid  mmmmm dennis quaid   setting his own trailer a rockin to shes a lady   priceless    best line missing from the quotes section btw   once youve had a clown  you never go back  i love this movie  i ordered the dvd from the us  and if the comments written by the kind of people whod be happier with legally blond 3 dont put you off   give it a try   
Absolutely horrific film. Ameteurish and it isn't funny at all. Lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Edits by E.T and star wars is just plain stupid.<br /><br />Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good think about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. Other than Goksal this movie is a garbage.<br /><br />Director Gani Mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date.<br /><br />Music of Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money.

"I heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see. Well, I rented it and I have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as ""April Fools Day"", ""Friday 13th"" and ""Prom Night"", this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story. Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer. Another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste, I was disappointed in his part in the end. As far as the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released as to who he was, I just laughed, but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. This movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory.",0,i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80s movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see  well  i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as  april fools day    friday 13th  and  prom night   this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story  characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer  another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket  he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting  instead  the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste  i was disappointed in his part in the end  as far as the true identity of the killer goes  when the identity was released as to who he was  i just laughed  but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed  this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but dont spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory

"If you enjoy films like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs. It is an unamusing, mean-spirited, insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst film I have seen in the past 18 months; mind-numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of it's runtime. Had it been much longer, I would not have been able to write this review without using profanity.

"1st watched 12/26/2008 -(Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs. The movie appears to be based on an earlier Italian movie according to the credits but was re-written by two fairly popular American romantic comedy writers. But this one by Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts. The story is about a couple of down-and-out traveling Americans, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return. Upon trying to return it, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money. They freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder. The other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a Monte Carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story. The other cast members include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police find out about the death, they start questioning the main characters and, of course, they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened. None of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the Belushi/Shepherd couple. This isn't a horrible movie, it just isn't that good. There are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile.

"Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They're all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of boring. I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better.

"Far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge as played by Mr. Scott seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought an richer, more robust, yet a more deeply moving Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century London. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal, understandable yet highly conflicted level; his role was acted with the great authority Scott always bring to the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper, almost as a soliloquy, as he would berate the Christmas holiday in one breath, yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line. He could portray the sour and crusty Scrooge, and a misunderstood, sympathetic Scrooge all in the same scene.<br /><br />Truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation.",1,far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30s and 50s  george c  scott was born to be scrooge  just as he was born to be patton  mr  scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century  the character of scrooge as played by mr  scott seemed to jump off the screen  scott as scrooge brought an richer  more robust  yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london  mr  scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal  understandable yet highly conflicted level  his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen  yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper  almost as a soliloquy  as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath  yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line  he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge  and a misunderstood  sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene  truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation 
"Director F.W. Murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the South Seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. The landscapes are beautiful, and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch. The film loses momentum, though, when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The storyline just never gets that interesting, despite being handled well by Murnau. Won an Academy Award for best cinematography, although the award probably should have been for best scenery. You can't really credit the DP for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location.",0,director f w  murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the south seas  the documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie  the landscapes are beautiful  and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch  the film loses momentum  though  when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers  the storyline just never gets that interesting  despite being handled well by murnau  won an academy award for best cinematography  although the award probably should have been for best scenery  you cant really credit the dp for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location

As I watched it, I started laughing, thinking to myself, does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real? So I had to look it up, and now see that it is a movie, but now since it isn't a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting. SO, either way, it is pretty bad. I actually didn't make it to the end. I had to shut it off. I am a NYC Police Officer, and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers.

"Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls. Script, pacing, and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequences defy belief. Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set, but also includes multiple sexual references involving Shields' character as well as graphic deaths. <br /><br />The movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny, an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid, and a children's movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. It also wants to be a buddy picture, a coming of age picture, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travelogue, and a western. The overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the Grand Canyon.

"Artemesia takes the usual story about the art world, eg, ""You can't paint that! But I want to!"" and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film, well, interesting, but not remarkable.<br /><br />The story is about one of the first female painters around, Artemesia who course, is fiercely independent, but just can't stop thinking of men, and their bodies for artistic purposes of course. She soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist, but soon tutoring becomes much more then art, and soon after that, scandal erupts! Funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft-porn fantasy. I mean, was Artemesia THAT much of a man-hungry person? Also, it's quite funny when she's insisting that she ""paints for herself!"" yet falls for the first person she sees.<br /><br />Actually, the story itself is quite fascinating, and it ends with a trial, which I always love. But I wasn't too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher, who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn't fall for.

"I thought this was an awesome movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning, when everything should have been normal. It was very weird and unrealistic. The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about. Apart from that, the movie was very creative. I think that all the acting was well done, the actors acted out their characters' personalities perfectly. Everything fit together well. It really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack. That would have been great!

Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I don't know why people think of this film as distorted. It was magical and it was lots of fun to watch. Every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better. You truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other, despite their age and differences.

"Seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions. Now at last on DVD in an unexpectedly handsome package, it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released. <br /><br />Gore Vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement. Most filmmakers felt that the novel's story, structure, and overall tone would not translate to film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen. But studio executives soon had cold feet: Vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer-director Michael Sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen.<br /><br />Studio executives hoped that Sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film, but Sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves. Rewrite upon rewrite followed. The cast, sensing disaster, became increasingly combative. In her DVD commentary, star Raquel Welch says that she seldom had any idea of what Myra's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself, and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film. In the accompanying ""Back Story"" documentary, Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls.<br /><br />The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself. The basics of Vidal's story are there, but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications, it seems to have no point in and of itself. Everything runs off in multiple directions, nothing connects, and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had. And while director Sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce, the only laughs generated are accidental.<br /><br />Chief among these accidents is Mae West. It is true that West is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one-liner--but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies, and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling, to say the least. But worse, really, is the fact that West is outside her era. Her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self-caricatures ever seen on film.<br /><br />The remaining cast is largely wasted. Raquel Welch, a significantly underestimated actress, plays the title role of Myra very much like a Barbie doll on steroids; non-actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron, but the entire role is essentially without point. Only John Huston and cameo players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper, and Andy Devine emerge relatively unscathed. Yes, it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be: fast when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast, relentlessly unfunny from start to finish. It is true that director Sarne does have the occasional inspired idea--as in his use of film clips of everyone from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create counterpoint to the action--but by and large, whenever Sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one.<br /><br />The how and why of that is made clear in Sarne's audio commentary. Sarne did not like the novel or, for that matter, the subject matter in general. He did not want to write the screenplay, but he needed the money; he emphatically did not want to direct the film, but he need the money. He makes it very clear that he disliked author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he flatly states that Reed ""is not a nice person""), and to this day he considers that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their 'homosexual agenda'--which, when you come right down to it, seems to have been their desire that Sarne actually film Vidal's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take-off on it.<br /><br />Although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community, Sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people. When taken in tandem with the film itself, Sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic--and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project.<br /><br />In addition to the Sarne and Welch commentaries and the making-of documentary, the DVD release includes several trailers and two versions of the film: a ""theatrical release"" version and a ""restored"" version. The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the ""restored"" version has been printed to black and white. The edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored, but the documentary details what they were. The widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine. But to end where I began, this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians, movie buffs, and cult movie fans. I give it three out of five stars for their sake alone, but everyone else should pass it by.<br /><br />Gary F.

"THE SEVENTH SIGN has a great opening hook as the Israeli defence force come across a terrorist base . This is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script , it grabs the reader / audience and the introduction of David Bannon as he rents a room from Abby and Russell Quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man who`s not who he says he is .

"`The Matrix' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `Twilight Zone'-ish manner. The general rule applies here- and this sequel doesn't match up to its predecessor. Worse than that, it doesn't even compare with it.<br /><br />`Reloaded' explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion. In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after that, the film nose-dives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end. Worst of all is the overlong `Zion Rave' scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.<br /><br />The bullet-time aspect of `The Matrix' was a good addition, but in `'Reloaded' they overuse to make it seem boring. In the first one there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically, just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is. It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better. It appears that `The Matrix' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `Star Wars' saga have.<br /><br />The acting standard is poor for the most part. The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving's `Agent Smith'- the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all the special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress. <br /><br />A poor, thrown-together movie, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a disappointment. Those who didn't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it. This one's for die-hard fans only. Even in the movie's own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.) this is still rather poor. My IMDb rating: 4.5/10.",0, the matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its  twilight zone ish manner  the general rule applies here  and this sequel doesnt match up to its predecessor  worse than that  it doesnt even compare with it   reloaded explodes onto the screen in the most un professional fashion  in the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as trinity is shot in a dream  immediately after that  the film nose dives  after a disastrous first 45 minutes  it gradually gains momentum when they enter the matrix and the agent smith battle takes place  but it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14 minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan worthy twist at the end  worst of all is the overlong  zion rave scene  not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot  but its also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music  the bullet time aspect of  the matrix was a good addition  but in  reloaded they overuse to make it seem boring  in the first one there were interesting plot turns  but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting  the movie is basically  just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is  it works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better  it appears that  the matrix franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the  star wars saga have  the acting standard is poor for the most part  the best character of course goes to hugo weavings  agent smith  the only one to be slightly interesting  keanu reeves is the definitive neo  but in all the special effects  there is little room to make much of an impact  academy award nominee laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue  carrie ann moss part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress   a poor  thrown together movie   the matrix reloaded is a disappointment  those who didnt like the first one are unlikely to flock to it  this ones for die hard fans only  even in the movies own sub genre of special effect bonanzas  minority report  the matrix etc   this is still rather poor  my imdb rating  4 5 10

"POSSIBLY VERY MINOR SPOILERS<br /><br />This movie is billed as the first Russian horror movie. Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, ""The Witch"" (its Russian title) will take a place of dishonor in the gallery of horrible Russian movies. It is based on Nikolai Gogol's story ""Viy"" which is a classic in Russia. ""Based"" is the key word here since no familiarity with the story is required. Instead, the less you know about Gogol, the better. <br /><br />It is a unique production because we are quite used to directors taking stories from other cultures and adapting them to their own culture. The spate of American remakes of foreign films is a prime example, but then again, Sturgess turned Kurosawa's Seven Samurai into The Magnificent Seven with splendid results, and Kurosawa transferred Shakespeare's Macbeth into Japan to make an incredibly powerful Throne in Blood, while King Lear became a riveting Ran. However, with ""The Witch,"" we have Russians transplanting a Russian classical tale onto the American soil. The movie was shot in Estonia in English with the aim of dubbing it into English using American actors and have reasonably synchronous lip movements. <br /><br />As a natural consequence, lost is the colorful Ukrainian background for the story, in comes a drab American small town seemingly lifted from some outdated horror book manual. Gone is the boozy seminarian Khoma Brutus, instead we have a boozy journalist who is about to win Pullitzer prize, and who at the same time writes about X-Files-like events and frequents Miss Boobs contests. (I never thought Pullitzer prize was given for that kind of writing, now I humbly stand corrected.) In a strange nod to Russianness, the journalist is named Ivan Berkhoff. They should've named him John Smith because it is impossible to get more hackneyed, clichéd and generic than this movie. <br /><br />Berkhoff goes to a town named Castleville, gets stranded on a dirt road, staggers on until he finds a dilapidated house and is rather un-welcomed by an old crone. All that to the accompaniment of a radio announcement about the forces of evil being at their most powerful, and people better staying indoors and avoiding water. Need I mention that it's raining really hard? After a few supposedly frightening scenes which had me laughing, the story finds our journalist dressed as a priest, he's mistaken for a priest, and the local sheriff tells him his daughter who died after being brutally attacked wanted the new priest to pray for her for three nights. At this point, the action supposedly starts. Those who have time to kill are welcome to it. <br /><br />What is wrong with this film? Everything, starting with the dialog and down to the prop department. The dialog which I heard in Russian was clearly originally written in English, and it was compiled exclusively from clichés and platitudes picked from American films. The actors just as clearly struggled with English because the timing of their speech was labored and unnatural, and the Russian dubbing followed suit. The acting is mostly atrocious, and not only because the actors find it often difficult to talk but because they don't have anything approaching a range of facial expressions. For the most part, they're just blank or you wish they were. The only exceptions being the sheriff played by Lembit Ulfsak, a fine Estonian actor, and Arnis Lizitis who plays a wheelchair bound resident of Castleville. Oh, and a rooster of course who's absolutely natural on camera! I know actors complain of being upstaged by dogs and cats but when Nikolaev is upstaged by a rooster it is a sad testimony to the general quality of acting in the film.<br /><br />There wasn't a single scary moment in the entire film, and there wasn't a single original moment in the film either. Mind you, this comment's coming from somebody who's rather inexperienced with horror. The film is filled with standard moves used in horror movie since the genre's inception. At a critical moment, the camera lingers lovingly on a kerosene lamp. The lamp promptly goes out. It must have seen a few horror movies, too. An example of supreme idiocy comes at another moment, a character jumps out of a bathtub and runs at the camera. He's wearing something the looks like loincloth! It doesn't get any more idiotic than this!<br /><br />Those in Russia who liked it claim it should've been advertised as a mystical thriller. I wasn't thrilled either. It was run-of-the-mill from start to finish. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the entire population of the little town behaved as if they knew exactly they lived in a horror movie, except they weren't quite sure whether it had zombies or not. Therefore, some of them acted zombie-like just in case. <br /><br />The makers of the film say it's about finding faith. Such a fine collections of idiotic actions, stupidly contrived moments, and, yes, clichés, doesn't deserve to be about finding faith. The movie is so thoroughly and utterly fake it deserves only to be an exhibit in a wax figure museum.",0,possibly very minor spoilers this movie is billed as the first russian horror movie

"Recently, I had opportunity to view a working print in Kansas City (Olathe, KS.) of this title. It is difficult for me, being a lover of the art as I am, to report the following, but, the truth sometimes hurts, and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe (I'm using the slang definition here - worthless statements or writing) for an hour and a half, I feel obligated to share (WARN) any interested parties. Let's begin at the beginning, a good place to start as always. The first 15 minutes are not really that bad, a couple of laughs, and decent development, but then it is downhill from there. This is the story of a woman, in her mid thirties, that (as the writer would like for you to believe) is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled. The first major difficulty occurs when if you don't know that fact going into the movie, you won't know it when she suddenly risks it all for, in my opinion, a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman. There is little development (drastically insufficient development) to justify her actions for the affair she has, and when it occurs, one feels, as I did, that she is just of low moral character. The word ""slut"" comes to mind, hopefully, they'll let that pass the review and post the comment. This, in my opinion, is the first fatal flaw of the film. If you're married or have ever been in love, irregardless of whether you are male or female, its going to turn you off. Quite frankly, I feel that it would have made a much better ""blue movie"" - that's the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving. The second fatal flaw is the casting, Diane Lane just didn't work for me here, and Viggo Mortensen is not the right man for the job, believe me. The only saving grace to the entire film is Anna Paquin, the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places, conveying a subtle yet very blunt (I apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate) portrayal of an emerging teen. Bravo, well done. I'm not going to give the ending away, but I was disappointed, being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing... but an ending like that.... Well, if that teased you enough to see this picture, don't say I didn't warn you, but you better look fast - if this celluloid is released, I doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames. I'd say wait for the video, but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value. Hmmm, Dustin Hoffman produced this, you think he'd learn after Ishtar. This film once carried the working title ""Blouse Man"" and should have been left on the rack. If you've never in your life wanted to walk out on a film, give this one 35-40 minutes, the only thing worth staying for is Anna Paquin, if you can stomach the fact that you'll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home, which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you're off to the movies to see this one. That's my two cents, for what it is worth.",0,recently  i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city  olathe  ks   of this title  it is difficult for me  being a lover of the art as i am  to report the following  but  the truth sometimes hurts  and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe  im using the slang definition here   worthless statements or writing  for an hour and a half  i feel obligated to share  warn  any interested parties  lets begin at the beginning  a good place to start as always  the first 15 minutes are not really that bad  a couple of laughs  and decent development  but then it is downhill from there  this is the story of a woman  in her mid thirties  that  as the writer would like for you to believe  is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled  the first major difficulty occurs when if you dont know that fact going into the movie  you wont know it when she suddenly risks it all for  in my opinion  a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman  there is little development  drastically insufficient development  to justify her actions for the affair she has  and when it occurs  one feels  as i did  that she is just of low moral character  the word  slut  comes to mind  hopefully  theyll let that pass the review and post the comment  this  in my opinion  is the first fatal flaw of the film  if youre married or have ever been in love  irregardless of whether you are male or female  its going to turn you off  quite frankly  i feel that it would have made a much better  blue movie    thats the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving  the second fatal flaw is the casting  diane lane just didnt work for me here  and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job  believe me  the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin  the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places  conveying a subtle yet very blunt  i apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate  portrayal of an emerging teen  bravo  well done  im not going to give the ending away  but i was disappointed  being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing    but an ending like that     well  if that teased you enough to see this picture  dont say i didnt warn you  but you better look fast   if this celluloid is released  i doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames  id say wait for the video  but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value  hmmm  dustin hoffman produced this  you think hed learn after ishtar  this film once carried the working title  blouse man  and should have been left on the rack  if youve never in your life wanted to walk out on a film  give this one 35 40 minutes  the only thing worth staying for is anna paquin  if you can stomach the fact that youll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home  which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if youre off to the movies to see this one  thats my two cents  for what it is worth 
"The story-line was rather interesting, but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts/behavior. More extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong in the casting. John Turtorro doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player, not to speak of the Italian player. Motives weren't very much outlined either.<br /><br />",1,the story line was rather interesting  but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts behavior  more extreme than necessary  also  i think something went wrong in the casting  john turtorro doesnt really satisfy me playing a semi autistic chess player  not to speak of the italian player  motives werent very much outlined either 
"When I was a kid I watched this many times over, and I remember whistling the ""Happy Cat"" song quite often. All the songs are great, and actually memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason. The scenes and costumes are lavish, and the acting is very well-done, which isn't surprising, considering the cast. Christopher Walken is very catlike, and doesn't need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human. And Jason Connery's so cute, as the shy and awkward miller's son, Corin, who falls in love with beautiful and the bold Princess Vera. This is a really fun, enjoyable, feature-length movie, where unlike most fairytales, the characters are given personalities. Some of my favourite parts are when Puss makes Corin pretend he's drowning; at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance, as it's ""all the rage abroad""; when Walken is in the kitchen, dancing on the table (he's a pretty good dancer, too!); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she used to do when she was young, like pretending she was a miller's daughter. I'd recommend this film to children and parents alike, who love magic and fairytales. And it actually IS a movie you can watch together, as it won't drive adults up the wall.",1,when i was a kid i watched this many times over  and i remember whistling the  happy cat  song quite often  all the songs are great  and actually memorable  unlike many childrens musicals  where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason  the scenes and costumes are lavish  and the acting is very well done  which isnt surprising  considering the cast  christopher walken is very catlike  and doesnt need stupid make up  or a cat costume for the viewer to believe hes a cat transformed to a human  and jason connerys so cute  as the shy and awkward millers son  corin  who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera  this is a really fun  enjoyable  feature length movie  where unlike most fairytales  the characters are given personalities  some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend hes drowning  at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance  as its  all the rage abroad   when walken is in the kitchen  dancing on the table  hes a pretty good dancer  too    and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young  like pretending she was a millers daughter  id recommend this film to children and parents alike  who love magic and fairytales  and it actually is a movie you can watch together  as it wont drive adults up the wall 
"this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life, and i've seen some pretty bad movies. i didn't like the way this movie was filmed. all of the actors are unknown, and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie. but it's absolutely horrible. i've never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake, and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming. the story is too weird. i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. there was no point in even filming this movie. if you're considering watching this movie, don't. you're just wasting your time.",0,this movie was definitely the worst movie ive seen in my entire life  and ive seen some pretty bad movies  i didnt like the way this movie was filmed  all of the actors are unknown  and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie  but its absolutely horrible  ive never seen a worse movie  the story is so fake  and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie  there was no plot  it looked as though it wasnt planned out before they started filming  the story is too weird  i didnt like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie  there was no point in even filming this movie  if youre considering watching this movie  dont  youre just wasting your time 
"Pet Sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a Stephen King novel.

"'The Vampire Bat' is definitely of interest, being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930's, but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise.<br /><br />The film is set in a European village sometime in the 19th Century, where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals. There is a very similar feel to James Whale's 'Frankenstein' and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill's Dr Niemann character, complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement.<br /><br />The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton Herman (Dwight Frye), thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one.<br /><br />This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred (also 'Doctor X' and 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum') and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements. Taken in context though, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and derivative.<br /><br />All we are left with is a poor-quality Frankenstein imitation, with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans. But for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer was doing the 'Blondie' films a few years later.",0,the vampire bat is definitely of interest  being one of the early genre setting horror films of the 1930s  but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise  the film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century  where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals  there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character  complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement  the vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red herring by having suspicion fall on bat loving village simpleton herman  dwight frye   thus providing the excuse for a torch wielding mob to go on the rampage   as if they needed one  this is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray co starred  also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum  and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements  taken in context though  the vampire bat is still weak and derivative  all we are left with is a poor quality frankenstein imitation  with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans  but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later

"And how it made it into production astounds me. The main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny. I can't stand the character at all. He's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show. <br /><br />This is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years, no joke. The story lines are both poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as the ones on Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not dislike this show more, it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title, even worse.<br /><br />It's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor.<br /><br />Johnny Test, go away far and fast!",0,and how it made it into production astounds me  the main character is an obnoxious show off who isnt the least bit funny  i cant stand the character at all  hes a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show   this is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years  no joke  the story lines are both poorly written and executed  the jokes are as bad as the ones on disneys sweet life of zack and cody  i could not dislike this show more  its terrible and should be canceled  even the theme song is bad  the title  even worse  its as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think theyre hot stuff when theyre really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor  johnny test  go away far and fast 
"The title alone (along with the poster) is enough to give away ""The Projected Man"" as an obvious rip-off of ""The Fly"". And Bryant Haliday, while much better than the typical IMDb review would have you think, is nobody's idea of an acceptable stand-in for Vincent Price. Although, come to think of it, who would be, unless Micheal Gough was available?? Still, if you are in the mood to watch a British ""Hammer"" style movie with a science fiction theme about a teleportation experiment gone horribly wrong...well, you still might want to give ""The Projected Man"" a pass and rummage around in the 'remaindered' bin at your local Wal-Mart for another teleporter-accident movie. Because this one just isn't all that good.<br /><br />Haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the MST3K crew for his part in this movie and in ""Devil Doll"", but he is actually the best thing in TPM. Maybe he can't carry the movie, but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay. The script bogs down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named Lembach and some sinister cabal who want the teleportation machine to fail so they can steal its secrets...or something. So all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent espresso machines and teleporting rats. Then when poor Haliday gets mutilated by his machine, he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaper over half his face and rubber cement over the rest while he electrocutes various Londoners who chance across his path. Tom Cruise and Eric Roberts using bullhorns couldn't have made this screenplay work. <br /><br />Meanwhile all the other actors diligently try to inject life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project, but the screenplay just swallows their efforts whole. The corrupt project administrator frets and fumes and hisses into the phone to his blackmailers, all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf outfitted in a tweed suit and a Tattersall vest. Haliday's research assistant and ex-girlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of British horror cinema. His secretary is forced to parade around in her ""smalls"". None of it really works or gels into a real movie. And it all just kind of stops dead, leaving the viewer going, ""Eh? excuse me, wasn't there supposed to be an ENDING here??""<br /><br />Still, for all its problems, I can easily name a dozen horror movies from the same period that were as bad or worse, and so could anyone else who follows movies (or who has ever browsed the IMDb ""Bottom 100""). I wouldn't actually pay money to own ""Projected Man"", but if it were included in some compilation along with a dozen other movies in a DVD collection, I'd probably feel OK about having it.

"It's got Christopher Lee, it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make Teletype noises as letters appear on the screen, it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises, it's got volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tidal waves! earthquakes! exploding cars! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax the entire planet blows up. How on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly, mind-numbingly DULL? The answer, my friend is because 90% of this movie is made up of establishing shots, most of them involving long tracks, pans, or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three, that do nothing except give the crew something to do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out of cars, driving again, walking around looking at stuff, getting in cars and driving... I just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering ""Say something, please somebody, just say something... DO something... anything!...""<br /><br />The dialogue, when it does come, is terrible.<br /><br />""Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours."" was a typically meaningless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage, justified in this speech from Lee as the head alien:<br /><br />""The planet Earth has emitted an over-abundance of diseases, they are contaminating the Universe. All the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed!"" <br /><br />This is is Neanderthal SF script writing. This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds. It is, and I collect such things, the most god-awful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired. It beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters.<br /><br />Lee, who always struck me as a smart, useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits, delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek.

"... so what's in those missing 10 minutes that were so horrible they had to cut them out from the original film? We were three years into the film production code... Barbara Stanwyck had starred in the original play, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for ""Double Indemnity"", with Stanwyck, as well as his hit TV show ""My Three Sons"". Keep an eye out for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and the too-fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who spiced up just about every film put on tape. Of course, he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever banter at the beginning. Maggie's buddy Ella is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in ""Holiday"" and ""My Man Godfrey"". In ""Swing High"", Maggie the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army. Maggie misses her boat when it leaves port and gets tangled up with the soldier. The dashing 20-something Quinn has a small scene at the local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) has been playing the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth), and Skid band together and try to figure out how to get back to the States. Some good singing by Lamour. Good (but brief) acting performance by Cecil Cunningham as ""Murph"", the wise, helpful owner of the local saloon in Panama. While others have lamented at how bad it is, it wasn't so awful, and is even a little exotic, with the fake Central America locale setting for the first half of the film.",1,    so whats in those missing 10 minutes that were so horrible they had to cut them out from the original film  we were three years into the film production code    barbara stanwyck had starred in the original play  but here  carole lombard plays maggie king  co star fred macmurray is probably best known for  double indemnity   with stanwyck  as well as his hit tv show  my three sons   keep an eye out for a young dorothy lamour  bob hope movies  and the too fabulous franklin pangborn  who spiced up just about every film put on tape  of course  he works in the beauty salon on the ship  add the sublime charles butterworth and anthony quinn  good timing and clever banter at the beginning  maggies buddy ella is played by jean dixon  who was the best friend in  holiday  and  my man godfrey   in  swing high   maggie the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army  maggie misses her boat when it leaves port and gets tangled up with the soldier  the dashing 20 something quinn has a small scene at the local bar in panama where johnson  macmurray  has been playing the trumpet  maggie  harry  butterworth   and skid band together and try to figure out how to get back to the states  some good singing by lamour  good  but brief  acting performance by cecil cunningham as  murph   the wise  helpful owner of the local saloon in panama  while others have lamented at how bad it is  it wasnt so awful  and is even a little exotic  with the fake central america locale setting for the first half of the film 
"Frankly I'm rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith I wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering. Have they all been written by his pals? The action clunks along, the music is irritating and over used, the script is simply dire and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) mediocre at best. I do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it's brilliant when it's not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i.e. continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture. Yes, it's his first film, low budget etc. - I get it, but it's also out there for members of the public to purchase and it's just not up to scratch.",0,frankly im rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering  have they all been written by his pals  the action clunks along  the music is irritating and over used  the script is simply dire and the actors  with the exception of the gardener  mediocre at best  i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying its brilliant when its not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i e  continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture  yes  its his first film  low budget etc    i get it  but its also out there for members of the public to purchase and its just not up to scratch

First off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is really low, and that also ruins the film. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton.

"Like his elder brothers, Claude Sautet and Jean-Pierre Melville, Alain Corneau began to cut his teeth in French cinema with a series of fine thrillers: ""la Menace"" (1977) and ""Série Noire"" (1979) among others. ""Police Python 357"" is a good example of how Corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career. They had a splendid cinematography, painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency's sake.<br /><br />The police superintendent Ferrot (Yves Montand) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone. He makes the acquaintance of a young woman Sylvia Léopardi (Stefania Sandrelli) and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover: his superior Ganay (François Périer). When the latter learns it, he kills her in a fit of anger. Ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him...<br /><br />One could deem that this kind of far-fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes, one can see right through it but Corneau's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling, dusky atmosphere. The first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however, it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment. Corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary, minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation. In spite of drawbacks, Corneau and his scenarist Daniel Boulanger penned a deft story. Ménard (Mathieu Carrière) who sometimes expresses his surprise because Ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation. But his superior knows that he usually works alone. Actually, Ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself. Eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself. He's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization. It is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them.<br /><br />The backdrop of this thriller, Orléans is efficiently enhanced by Corneau's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm.",1,like his elder brothers  claude sautet and jean pierre melville  alain corneau began to cut his teeth in french cinema with a series of fine thrillers   la menace   1977  and  série noire   1979  among others   police python 357  is a good example of how corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career  they had a splendid cinematography  painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiencys sake  the police superintendent ferrot  yves montand  is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone  he makes the acquaintance of a young woman sylvia léopardi  stefania sandrelli  and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover  his superior ganay  françois périer   when the latter learns it  he kills her in a fit of anger  ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him    one could deem that this kind of far fetched story isnt exempt from glitches and sometimes  one can see right through it but corneaus pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling  dusky atmosphere  the first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however  it is crucial for what will follow this key moment  corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary  minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation  in spite of drawbacks  corneau and his scenarist daniel boulanger penned a deft story  ménard  mathieu carrière  who sometimes expresses his surprise because ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation  but his superior knows that he usually works alone  actually  ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself  eventually  the chief idea of the film concerns ferrot himself  hes a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization  it is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses wont recognize him when he is brought face to face with them  the backdrop of this thriller  orléans is efficiently enhanced by corneaus camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm

"This movie is one of the worst ones of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. I have never watched Desparte Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. It's like she knows nothing about acting. All her character does is whine throughout the film, and she can't pull off being a b**** and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />As for the story, it is so cookie cutter.

"Probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful, dramatic episode (in this case, the superb Balance of Terror) with a lighter affair, Shore Leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the Star Trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci-fi, and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry (the true triumph is Trouble with Tribbles, in Season 2), the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness.<br /><br />Diverting from the show's tradition, the Enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty: a well deserved break after three months of incessant work. The Earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: Dr. McCoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people begin experiencing similar things: a woman meets a Don Juan-like character, Sulu has a run-in with a samurai, and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past, in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the Academy. Throw in a freakishly real-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt.<br /><br />The idea is a classic one: idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly. The episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful, weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again come the end) and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves (most notably, and ironically, the otherwise hilarious William Shatner). And yet Shore Leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new, previously unseen things: the definition of Star Trek's success.<br /><br />7,5/10",1,probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful  dramatic episode  in this case  the superb balance of terror  with a lighter affair  shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci fi  and while the formula isnt quite right yet in this entry  the true triumph is trouble with tribbles  in season 2   the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness  diverting from the shows tradition  the enterprise isnt on any proper mission in this episode  instead  kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty  a well deserved break after three months of incessant work  the earth like planet  a budget related fact  is very appealing  but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens  dr  mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carrolls work  soon  other people begin experiencing similar things  a woman meets a don juan like character  sulu has a run in with a samurai  and kirk faces a double encounter with the past  in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy  throw in a freakishly real looking tiger  and its easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out whats going on before anybody gets hurt  the idea is a classic one  idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly  the episodes humorous take on the topic is rather successful  werent it for a dark turn of events that doesnt sit well with the rest  of course  everything works out fine again come the end  and the casts general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves  most notably  and ironically  the otherwise hilarious william shatner   and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new  previously unseen things  the definition of star treks success  7 5 10
"""Red Rock West"" was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script (by John and Rick Dahl) that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and featured a marvellous cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance) making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed. The film never had much publicity on release (in fact I first caught up with it on TV) and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock. Mistaken for a contract killer named Lyle from Dallas he is shocked to be offered $10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double dealings - that Cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of! Then just to complicate matters even further the real Lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing (played by everyone's favourite heavy Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what has happened he goes after Cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow.<br /><br />Some favourite lines from the film:<br /><br />Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): ""I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money"".<br /><br />J. T. Walsh (to Cage): ""Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this"".<br /><br />Boyle (to Cage): ""You're not a killer?"". Cage: ""That's right, no. But the guy I'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here"".<br /><br />Boyle (to Cage): ""O.K. How you're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking $10,000 from my husband?"".<br /><br />An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (just 98 minutes) with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals. Any film featuring J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and ""Red Rock West"" was one of his best. How sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period for ""film noir"" was without any doubt the forties but ""Red Rock West"" is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my ""Top Ten"" list of all time favourite films. I look forward to more like this from director John Dahl. 10/10.

"For those who commented on The Patriot as being accurate, (Which basically satanised the English), it was interesting to see this film. By all accounts this was the bloodiest war that Americans have ever been involved in, and they were the only nationality present. It was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the Atlantic that did not paint America as either martyrs or saviours. All in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict, and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all.",1,for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate   which basically satanised the english   it was interesting to see this film  by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in  and they were the only nationality present  it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours  all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict  and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts  often culminating in the suffering of the innocent  this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all 
"""Death Lends A Hand"" is one of the pivotal early episodes of ""Columbo"" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. It marks the first of Robert Culp's four appearances (three as a murderer), playing much the same role in each show.<br /><br />In this case Culp plays Brimmer, the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, Mr Kennicut, is having an affair. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husband's business associates. She reacts badly to this suggestion, an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as Brimmer whacks her across the face. Because he is wearing a large ring, the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her.<br /><br />There are some really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favourite scenes is where Columbo pretends to be into palm-reading, although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring. Columbo being Columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little. So initially he goofily plays the part of a rather simple-minded man who gets excited by the ""lifeline going over the mound of the moon"", or some equally ridiculous palm-reading mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br />Another great scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his firm, effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose around. Again, Columbo doesn't reveal that he knows what's going on, he pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer.<br /><br />And there's another where Columbo says to Kennicut, in front of Brimmer, that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation. He wants to hint to Brimmer that he is onto him, without directly accusing him, so he rather cruelly (but understandable in the circumstances) decides to play mindgames on Brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid. Which of course he does! All the while, the grieving Kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. It's only near the end that Columbo explains all to Kennicut (not shown on screen).<br /><br />I won't reveal how Columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights, but let's just say there's a potato involved... <br /><br />A really really good episode, possibly the very best of the first series. If you liked this then you'll like ""Double Exposure"" too, also featuring Robert Culp.",1, death lends a hand  is one of the pivotal early episodes of  columbo  that helped define the show for the next thirty years  it marks the first of robert culps four appearances  three as a murderer   playing much the same role in each show  in this case culp plays brimmer  the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate  mr kennicut  is having an affair  although she is  brimmer decides not to tell kennicut  in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husbands business associates  she reacts badly to this suggestion  an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as brimmer whacks her across the face  because he is wearing a large ring  the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her  there are some really priceless moments in this episode  one of my favourite scenes is where columbo pretends to be into palm reading  although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of brimmers ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring  columbo being columbo  he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little  so initially he goofily plays the part of a rather simple minded man who gets excited by the  lifeline going over the mound of the moon   or some equally ridiculous palm reading mumbo jumbo  another great scene is when brimmer tries to offer columbo a job for his firm  effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose around  again  columbo doesnt reveal that he knows whats going on  he pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer  and theres another where columbo says to kennicut  in front of brimmer  that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation  he wants to hint to brimmer that he is onto him  without directly accusing him  so he rather cruelly  but understandable in the circumstances  decides to play mindgames on brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid  which of course he does  all the while  the grieving kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation  its only near the end that columbo explains all to kennicut  not shown on screen   i wont reveal how columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights  but lets just say theres a potato involved     a really really good episode  possibly the very best of the first series  if you liked this then youll like  double exposure  too  also featuring robert culp 
"First, let me say that Notorious is an absolutely charming film, very lovingly rendered of its time and subject(s). Gretchen Mol is utterly, painfully convincing, the very soul of the contradictions smoothly reified by Ms. Page herself. Irving and Paula Klaw are richly drawn as the working-class stiffs they were (having met Paula at Movie Star News in 1990 I can say that Lili Taylor's performance is unimpeachable), and Jared Harris as John Willie (Coutts) is an adoringly debauched genius. Anyone with an interest in the recorded history of American attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie, in a theater preferably, where votes made with dollars count more.<br /><br />Second, I will allow that I am a producer of material similar to that for which the Klaws would become famous, which is no way affects my estimation of Ms. Harron's work as the splendid piece that it is, but does condition my view of Notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order. Ms. Harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion. Along with V for Vendetta, it is a movie about another time for our times.<br /><br />Few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in Notorious (through transcription of the very words uttered in closed Senate committee hearings) is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now. While Ms. Harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film, her faithfulness to the facts, and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them, synchronizes Notorious with the present day. The very acts that Notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the Communications Decency Act, recently brought to the Supreme Court as a First Amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the Bush administration. In other words, the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in Notorious is indictable today by Federal prosecutors in whatever (hostile) jurisdiction they choose. Of course, there were no hearings in the Senate or elsewhere on this matter when the CDA was passed. Of course you know nothing about it, because you don't want people in Peoria telling you what you can and cannot look at (likewise, people in Peoria probably don't want me telling them what they're allowed to view). Of course Notorious will never be indicted. It's Hollywood. It's lawyered up. Countless Klaws will, however, continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic, moral or biological composition much in 50+ years.<br /><br />In addition, Notorious posts no 18 USC 2257 compliance statement, which is mandated by the unnoticed ""earmark"" recently voted into law. If any media contains images of ""sadomasochistic restraint"" it is required to make available (ex warrant) records of age and circumstance of all performers. Notorious fails in this regard also.<br /><br />In addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an (nearly) accurate historical document, Notorious will be the litmus against which the Bush Justice Department is itself judged with respect to the 14th (Equal Protection) Amendment and on perhaps several other Constitutional grounds. In this regard alone, a debt of gratitude is owed Mary Harron. You'll be grateful in any case, Constitutional or otherwise, if you see this film.",1,first  let me say that notorious is an absolutely charming film  very lovingly rendered of its time and subject s   gretchen mol is utterly  painfully convincing  the very soul of the contradictions smoothly reified by ms  page herself  irving and paula klaw are richly drawn as the working class stiffs they were  having met paula at movie star news in 1990 i can say that lili taylors performance is unimpeachable   and jared harris as john willie  coutts  is an adoringly debauched genius  anyone with an interest in the recorded history of american attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie  in a theater preferably  where votes made with dollars count more  second  i will allow that i am a producer of material similar to that for which the klaws would become famous  which is no way affects my estimation of ms  harrons work as the splendid piece that it is  but does condition my view of notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order  ms  harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion  along with v for vendetta  it is a movie about another time for our times  few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in notorious  through transcription of the very words uttered in closed senate committee hearings  is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now  while ms  harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film  her faithfulness to the facts  and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them  synchronizes notorious with the present day  the very acts that notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the communications decency act  recently brought to the supreme court as a first amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the bush administration  in other words  the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in notorious is indictable today by federal prosecutors in whatever  hostile  jurisdiction they choose  of course  there were no hearings in the senate or elsewhere on this matter when the cda was passed  of course you know nothing about it  because you dont want people in peoria telling you what you can and cannot look at  likewise  people in peoria probably dont want me telling them what theyre allowed to view   of course notorious will never be indicted  its hollywood  its lawyered up  countless klaws will  however  continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic  moral or biological composition much in 50  years  in addition  notorious posts no 18 usc 2257 compliance statement  which is mandated by the unnoticed  earmark  recently voted into law  if any media contains images of  sadomasochistic restraint  it is required to make available  ex warrant  records of age and circumstance of all performers  notorious fails in this regard also  in addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an  nearly  accurate historical document  notorious will be the litmus against which the bush justice department is itself judged with respect to the 14th  equal protection  amendment and on perhaps several other constitutional grounds  in this regard alone  a debt of gratitude is owed mary harron  youll be grateful in any case  constitutional or otherwise  if you see this film

"What the F*@# was this I just watched? Steven STOP!! Please! This movie is insatiably bad and silly. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (obviously) wish-they-were-vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength.? OK? Oh, and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way? Wow! Even still in this movie however, to quell Seagals have-to-have-the-last-punch-and-no-one-can-kick-my-a$$ ego, HE is somehow stronger than they are. However all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him. Come on, I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer, but these are super human strength people. Oh and get this, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues, because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is Wolverine! Oh My GO... And worst than all of that! Yes, there is a worse than that. He has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face. They obviously sound nothing like him and I believe it may be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off I always watch a movie to he end. This is an all time low even for your direct to video movies Steven. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two thumbs down! Redemeption qualities? Well I guess so, I will be fair in that aspect. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses. The women all were quite attractive IMO. Still, and I said STILL, it does not make up for the blatant X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) rip off! The director, writer, producer, ALL should be bansihed & exile from the movie business.

"I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've seen. It was ultra high-tech for it's time. It could repel enemy fire, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air, and take down nearly anything in it's way. Now I go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is. The casts members are hardly compelling, there are a lot of cheesy moments, and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking. And nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage.

"Frequently voted China's greatest film ever by Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from the outside, and, frankly, I don't get it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, blandly directed and acted, with a complete shrew for a protagonist. Wei Wei (don't laugh) is that shrew, a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) for the past several years. It is post WWII, and they live with the husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated home with not much money (the man had been wealthy when they married). Along comes the husband's old best friend (Wei Li), who also used to be the wife's boyfriend when they were teens. She considers running away from her husband with this man, while the husband pretty much remains oblivious, thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend. That's the set-up, and it doesn't go anywhere you wouldn't expect it to. I've actually seen the remake, directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It runs a half hour longer, and is actually kind of dull, too, but at least it was pretty. This supposed classic is pretty intolerable.",0,frequently voted chinas greatest film ever by chinese critics  as well as chinese film enthusiasts from the outside  and  frankly  i dont get it at all  what i saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable  blandly directed and acted  with a complete shrew for a protagonist  wei wei  dont laugh  is that shrew  a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband  yu shi  for the past several years  it is post wwii  and they live with the husbands teenage sister  hongmei zhang  in a dilapidated home with not much money  the man had been wealthy when they married   along comes the husbands old best friend  wei li   who also used to be the wifes boyfriend when they were teens  she considers running away from her husband with this man  while the husband pretty much remains oblivious  thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend  thats the set up  and it doesnt go anywhere you wouldnt expect it to  ive actually seen the remake  directed by blue kite director zhuangzhuang tian  it runs a half hour longer  and is actually kind of dull  too  but at least it was pretty  this supposed classic is pretty intolerable 
"Please see also my comment on Die Nibelungen part 1: Siegfried.<br /><br />The second part of UFA studio's gargantuan production of the Nibelungen saga continues in the stylised, symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor. However, whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism, part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale.<br /><br />As in part one, director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm, with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands. These pictures should only be watched with the note-perfect Gottfried Huppertz score, which fortunately is on the Kino DVD. Now, with this focus on mass action, Lang is presented with greater challenges in staging. The action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed, but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow, with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra.<br /><br />But just as part one made us witness Siegfried's adventures matter-of-factly and without excitement, part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy. In both pictures, there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters. That's why Lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action, never allowing us to feel as if we are there (and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of Lang's work). That's also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical, with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Kriemhild's revenge does constantly deal with emotions, and is in fact profoundly humanist. The one moment of naturalism is when Atilla holds his baby son for the first time, and Lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild, frantic ride of the huns. The point is that Lang never manipulates us into taking sides, and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the Wagner opera. The climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene. Why then did Hitler and co. get so teary-eyed over it, a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films? Because the unwavering racial ideology of the Nazis made them automatically view the Nibelungs as the good guys, even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin. For Hitler, their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy, not a human one.<br /><br />But for us non-nazi viewers, what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm. When you see these fully-developed silent pictures of Lang's, it makes you realise how much he was wasted in Hollywood. Rather than saddling him with low-budget potboilers, they should have put him to work on a few of those sword-and-sandal epics, pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally, where it's the poetic, operatic tonality that sweeps us along.",1,please see also my comment on die nibelungen part 1  siegfried  the second part of ufa studios gargantuan production of the nibelungen saga continues in the stylised  symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor  however  whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism  part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale  as in part one  director fritz lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm  with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands  these pictures should only be watched with the note perfect gottfried huppertz score  which fortunately is on the kino dvd  now  with this focus on mass action  lang is presented with greater challenges in staging  the action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed  but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow  with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra  but just as part one made us witness siegfrieds adventures matter of factly and without excitement  part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy  in both pictures  there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters  thats why lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action  never allowing us to feel as if we are there  and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of langs work   thats also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical  with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers  nevertheless  kriemhilds revenge does constantly deal with emotions  and is in fact profoundly humanist  the one moment of naturalism is when atilla holds his baby son for the first time  and lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild  frantic ride of the huns  the point is that lang never manipulates us into taking sides  and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the wagner opera  the climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene  why then did hitler and co  get so teary eyed over it  a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films  because the unwavering racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the nibelungs as the good guys  even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin  for hitler  their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy  not a human one  but for us non nazi viewers  what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm  when you see these fully developed silent pictures of langs  it makes you realise how much he was wasted in hollywood  rather than saddling him with low budget potboilers  they should have put him to work on a few of those sword and sandal epics  pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally  where its the poetic  operatic tonality that sweeps us along 
"An occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people's buttons., the 4th Man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct. The story's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously twisted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers up<br /><br />Gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man. He's shiftless, delusional, unable to control his urges, afraid to commit to<br /><br />meaningful relationships, and utterly apathetic about life in general. As the character himself states at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth.<br /><br />The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of spiders consuming Christ, and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction. He chases off<br /><br />one man (a boyfriend presumably), then chases another at a train station. Later, at a lecture, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, or<br /><br />perhaps she has more nefarious plans.. She quickly captures Gerard in her web, enticing him with sex and money, having plenty of both. She's also got<br /><br />secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she lonely, and genuinely looking for someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow, luring Gerard to his<br /><br />death? Will Garard be the 4th man she kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to.<br /><br />This is an interesting movie, with a lot of sex and intrigue. It's similar to Verhoeven's<em>Basic instinct</em>, but has a lot more depth, and is certainly more shocking. There's a lot of very strong gay content, which may make some viewers squirm.

"This is a perfect series for family viewing. We gather around the TV to watch this on BBC America. It is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it appeals to children and adults alike. Our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching Robin's next exploits. We can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free ""On Demand"" viewing.<br /><br />The wardrobe has a spot of current fashion. There is a moral to each story. It is entertaining. The violence is not over-the-top or needless. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a John William's feel to it. It is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair.<br /><br />There is so much garbage on television from brain rotting ""reality"" TV to senseless violence. You should take this for what it is and that is an updated ""Robin Hood"" not to be compared with the movie exploits of Errol Flynn. This is a gem to be enjoyed by all. Parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight. Maid Marian is also an appealing role model for young girls. Rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the ""Night Watchman."" The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked, just as the Sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, one that makes most women wish he didn't have portray the role of a bad ""Guy"". <br /><br />The only question we have is ""Where is Friar Tuck?""",1,this is a perfect series for family viewing  we gather around the tv to watch this on bbc america  it is an up to date version of robin hood and it appeals to children and adults alike  our teenager and tween ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching robins next exploits  we cant wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free  on demand  viewing  the wardrobe has a spot of current fashion  there is a moral to each story  it is entertaining  the violence is not over the top or needless  the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a john williams feel to it  it is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair  there is so much garbage on television from brain rotting  reality  tv to senseless violence  you should take this for what it is and that is an updated  robin hood  not to be compared with the movie exploits of errol flynn  this is a gem to be enjoyed by all  parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed  he is a robin hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight  maid marian is also an appealing role model for young girls  rather than stand by and do nothing  she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the  night watchman   the sheriff of nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked  just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between billy joel and tim curry  guy gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor  one that makes most women wish he didnt have portray the role of a bad  guy    the only question we have is  where is friar tuck

"If there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it's seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better. This ""re-imagining"" of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.<br /><br />There were problems in basic plot development. The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. Even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston's Taylor as being different from the other humans. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. They are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can't do. It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.<br /><br />It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.<br /><br />The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson (Wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. This was poor character development. (Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). Wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.<br /><br />Creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: Ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in The Green Mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. But the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon's rocket: jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. Secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.<br /><br />In the original film, the various ""human"" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief (""I never knew an ape I didn't like."" ""Human see, human do!""). Here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st Century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.<br /><br />Nothing made me cringe more than the ""V-Ger from Star Trek"" moment near the end of the film. First of all, the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form. Secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. This moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.<br /><br />Things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. Back in the '60s and '70s, they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. I'm thinking of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. However, this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. In a contemporary setting, you'd have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it's ""science fiction"" you don't have to!<br /><br />Overall, Burton's most disappointing film.",0,if theres

"I don't hand out ""ones"" often, but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention, it's ""Gas!"" This is self-indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of M*A*S*H and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt.<br /><br />I see what Corman was going for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's deathless role in the original movie version of M*A*S*H with a similar plot (in the movie ""Whiffs"" - look it up here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891/ for more information).<br /><br />Marmorstein and Gould got closer to the brass ring with ""Whiffs"" than Corman did with ""Gas!"" but didn't quite get there. Neither one of those films even got close to the success of M*A*S*H.<br /><br />What's wrong with ""Gas!""? What isn't? No one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics. The production values stink. Someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car, and there's more of that lack of attention to detail. Nothing works the way it's supposed to in this film, and nobody cares.<br /><br />""Gas!"" actually put me to sleep. It's not a sure cure for insomnia, but really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale, ""Gas!"" falls somewhere between ""Last Year at Marienbad"" and George Clooney's remake of ""Solaris"" (which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the Mosfilm original, despite that studio's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience's attention by judicious editing).<br /><br />Judicious editing would have decimated ""Gas!"" to about twenty minutes. The result would be pointless, but no more so than the original film.<br /><br />Certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway.

"If you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one Latin country with any other Latin country, ""The Celestine Prophecy"" is a good example: 1. Perú, not even in its most violent times, has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film. This showed a country like El Salvador when Civil War. Since I'm a Peruvian who lives in Lima (the capital of Perú), it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here, there and everywhere. 2. If you have a car in Perú, and you want (or need) to be a taxi driver, just post a sticker with the word ""Taxi"" on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in Peruvian streets (there are taxi companies, but their rates are quite expensive). No need of yellow or a black/white squared band on the doors of your car. Well, taxis in this film have that band, somethin that you will never see in Perú. 3. Peruvian people are not Caribbean styled clothing. For example, when a taxi driver comes out, he was wearing a ""Guayabera"" (Cuban shirt), a white hat, and 40's mustaches, like Clark Gable. Not one Peruvian man looks like that, please! Perú is not the Caribbeans! 4. A scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt, like the typical folklore dresses in Latin America. Take a walk anywhere in Perú, and you'll never find a woman wearing like that, unless you are watching a typical dance. 5. Cast could've been better: I can not deny Héctor Elizondo is a great actor, but he's not a Latin actor (his father was Basque and his mother from Puerto Rico, but he was born in New York) and his Spanish is not fluent. It's notorious Spanish is not his first language. There are dozens of very good Latin actors who could've performed as Cardinal Sebastián. Petrus Antonius (General Rodríguez) was also a bad choice for a ""Latin Police officer"". It was so funny seeing Elizondo and Petronius in General Rodríguez's office. They looked like two English or American students in a Spanish class, making their best effort in order to pronounce Spanish. Unsuccessfully, of course. Castulo Guerra was better in his Spanish. A ""Peruvian"" officer, who announced Cardinal Sebastián, spoke a quite funny Spanish too. There are very good Peruvian actors, like Augusto Alvarez-Calderón and Christian Meier (just to mention two out of many Peruvian actors), who could've performed with excellence. 6. I admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or, even, countries. But, please, when creating a name, be careful when using a foreign language: The town portrayed in this movie should've been called ""Vicente"" and not ""Viciente"". Vicente is a male name, and Viciente has never been used. 7. I disagree one user, who says that this movie was filmed on locations in Perú. Not one location is Peruvian, although the production has used in excess posters showing ""Inca Kola"", the Peruvian soda. As not few American films, this one must have used any Latin country. After all, for American producers or directors, a Latin place is identical to any other Latin place. 8. In the first scenes, when John (Matthew Settle) flies to Perú, he's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in Perú: Jorge Chávez Airport (in Lima, the capital). Actually, believe me, it must be any airport in the world, but Peruvian airport. And, of course, in Peruvian airports there are no military or police guards. 9. When this John takes a room in a Peruvian hotel, this one has a fan and, obviously has no air conditioner. Please, this doesn't happen in no hotel in Perú(and other Latin countries), unless you get a 1 star hotel! 10. The rebels who fight against the government are... ¡Colombians! Their accent was, with no doubt, from Colombia. For casting them, the producers should've hired Peruvian actors. In few words, it would've been cheaper filming in Perú.<br /><br />I could go on with more examples out of this film, that led me to give it a ""1"" (awful) vote, but I fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning. But dear producers: It's not a tragedy: There are many worse movies with not few mistakes. Just let's remember ""Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crystal skull"" and indescribable Disney's ""The Emperor's new groove"".

"I'm glad that this is available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content & style over empty-headed flashing lights & constant loud noises.<br /><br />Essentially, if you have a short attention span or lack the wit & imagination to engage with literary narrative you won't like this film. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of Catherine Storr's novel 'Marianne Dreams' successfully to a screenplay. An unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know.<br /><br />The casting is excellent, allowing director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; they indulge in the craft of acting! I know, I know, actors doing their job & acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions & fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat, but it does actually happen in this film.<br /><br />This brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker & not the spoon-fed tabloid reader - Apart from a solid script, direction & acting, it relies on atmosphere, suspense & implied horror. If it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of 'Paper House' is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper.<br /><br />In conclusion then, if you like lots of loud noises, explosions, constant cuts, & bright flashing colours you'd be better off watching 'Transformers', but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful & evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you cacophonous nonsense then this might just be your thing.",1,im glad that this is available on dvd now  this film is an excellent example of the triumph of content   style over empty headed flashing lights   constant loud noises  essentially  if you have a short attention span or lack the wit   imagination to engage with literary narrative you wont like this film  the reasons for this are quite simple  but unfortunately rarely achieved  matthew jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of catherine storrs novel marianne dreams successfully to a screenplay  an unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know  the casting is excellent  allowing director bernard rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now  they indulge in the craft of acting  i know  i know  actors doing their job   acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases  explosions   fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat  but it does actually happen in this film  this brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker   not the spoon fed tabloid reader   apart from a solid script  direction   acting  it relies on atmosphere  suspense   implied horror  if it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of paper house is more in the vein of sophocles than tobe hooper  in conclusion then  if you like lots of loud noises  explosions  constant cuts    bright flashing colours youd be better off watching transformers  but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful   evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you cacophonous nonsense then this might just be your thing

But what happened affter Owens death made me very mad.<br /><br />Rather then ending the pay per view and doing the right thing as human beings the WWE decided to protect what comes first and that was the money by keeping the pay per view going as if Owens death never happened.<br /><br />I gotta tell you. Vince Mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made.<br /><br />And this crap with saying Owen would have wanted the pay pew view to keep going.

"This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was actually expecting a bad movie but I was caught by surprise believe it or not.

The photo is not too good, the music is so malplacée it actually made me angry, the actors are not even trying, altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the ""action"" itself.<br /><br />I dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming, who is financing this shit? Where is the screening ? And why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script?<br /><br />There are a million hollywood-movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters, but even them Straight To Video things actually manages to look professional in comparison.<br /><br />I can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all, I feel robbed of 2 hours of my life.",0,this must be one of the worst movies i have ever seen  i was actually expecting a bad movie but i was caught by surprise believe it or not  the storyline is the traditional  all clichées are included  the dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half descent actors are trying to make it sound real  the photo is not too good  the music is so malplacée it actually made me angry  the actors are not even trying  altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the  action  itself  i dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming  who is financing this shit  where is the screening   and why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script  there are a million hollywood movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters  but even them straight to video things actually manages to look professional in comparison  i can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all  i feel robbed of 2 hours of my life 
"I had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct Sicilian TV channel; amazingly, the film emerged as a heftily-priced DVD from Criterion: not being sure what I had made of it initially (despite having attained cult status over the years, the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs), I opted not to make the purchase  as I did with the similar and, to me, unfamiliar FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958). Recently, however, I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which, interestingly, ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion ""Special Edition""but, regrettably, I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature! Anyway, looking at the film anew, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it (despite many a narrative flaw, which I will get to later)  as a pure example of 'B-movie' schlockiness (atypically shot in pleasant color) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes. The male lead was an early role for Steve(n) McQueen and, though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain, his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging: not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent (and, more importantly, altruistic) kid. The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema (showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR [1953/7] as I mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence, incidentally, would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called ""Blob""!). As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film: the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places, never being seen by anyone!; there is a baffling over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) on the kids' scrapes with Police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob  as if fluid, whatever its proportion, can be destroyed by bullets!; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits (especially when considering that, at that stage, only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action)! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB!; the original was then remade in 1988  I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me (though I know Micheal Elliott loves it). For the record, I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris, namely 4D MAN (1959) and DINOSAURUS! (1960).",1,i had first watched this several years ago on a now defunct sicilian tv channel  amazingly  the film emerged as a heftily priced dvd from criterion  not being sure what i had made of it initially  despite having attained cult status over the years  the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs   i opted not to make the purchase  as i did with the similar and  to me  unfamiliar fiend without a face  1958   recently  however  i managed to acquire the blob via a copy of the spanish dvd which  interestingly  ported over the two audio commentary tracks from the criterion  special edition but  regrettably  i could not switch off the spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature  anyway  looking at the film anew  i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it  despite many a narrative flaw  which i will get to later   as a pure example of b movie schlockiness  atypically shot in pleasant color  and a time capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes  the male lead was an early role for steve n  mcqueen and  though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain  his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging  not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent  and  more importantly  altruistic  kid  the special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period  the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monsters invasion of a cinema  showing daughter of horror  1953 7  as i mentioned recently in that films review but being curiously screened flipped and which sequence  incidentally  would be featured at the opening of a satirical italian program actually called  blob     as to the admittedly minor quibbles i have with the film  the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places  never being seen by anyone   there is a baffling over emphasis  tantamount to padding  on the kids scrapes with police  it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at the blob  as if fluid  whatever its proportion  can be destroyed by bullets   equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door to door visits  especially when considering that  at that stage  only mcqueen had actually seen the monster in action   an inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called beware the blob   the original was then remade in 1988  i watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me  though i know micheal elliott loves it   for the record  i will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director yeaworth and producer jack h  harris  namely 4d man  1959  and dinosaurus   1960

The story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares.<br /><br />The editing and visual fx are also top notch.

"""Raw Force"" is like an ultra-sleazy and perverted version of Love Boat, with additional Kung Fu fights, demented cannibalistic monks, white slaves trade, energetic zombies and a whole lot of lousy acting performances. No wonder this movie was included in the recently released ""Grindhouse Experience 20 movie box-set"". It's got everything exploitation fanatics are looking for, blend in a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised script! The production values are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic, but the amounts of gratuitous violence & sex can hardly be described. The film opens at a tropically sunny location called Warriors Island, where a troop of sneering monks raise the dead for no apparent reason other than to turn them into Kung Fu fighters. The monks also buy sexy slaves from a sleazy Hitler look-alike businessman, supposedly because the women's flesh supplies them with the required powers to increase their zombie army. Tourists on a passing cruise ship, among them three martial arts fighters, a female LA cop and a whole bunch of ravishing but dim-witted ladies, are attacked by the Hitler guy's goons because they were planning an excursion to Warriors Island. Their lifeboat washes ashore the island anyway, and the monks challenge the survivors to a fighting test with their zombies. Okay, how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie mess? It's not over yet, because ""Raw Force"" also has piranhas, wild boat orgies, Cameron Mitchell in yet another embarrassing lead role and 70's exploitation duchess Camille Keaton (""I spit on your Grave"") in an utterly insignificant cameo appearance. There's loads of badly realized gore, including axe massacres and decapitations, hammy jokes and bad taste romance. The trash-value of this movie will literally leave you speechless. The evil monks' background remains, naturally, unexplained and they don't even become punished for their questionable hobbies.

Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (as Philip Carey); he dreams of becoming a painter, but is told he has no talent for the arts. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard's struggles, instead, to become a doctor. His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts; though successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier - also, note the symbolism of his disability, a ""club foot"" (explained in the film).<br /><br />Along the way (right away, in this version), Howard becomes infatuated with waitress Davis (as Mildred Rogers). Davis' characterization of ""Mildred"" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech, when she tells Howard, among other things, that she had to ""WIPE MY MOUTH!"" after kissing him. Howard also performs well, but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis; so, their performances are wasted. <br /><br />Still, a film to watch for the acting, including some good supporting players. Bette Davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a ""write-in"" campaign for the 1934 ""Best Actress"" Academy Award. For the record, she placed third. The results were: <br /><br />1. Claudette Colbert - ""It Happened One Night"" <br /><br />2. Norma Shearer - ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"" <br /><br />3. Bette Davis - ""Of Human Bondage"" <br /><br />4.

"Ok, first of all, I am a huge zombie movie fan. I loved all of Romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of Dawn of the Dead. So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot. This however, is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare. And very badly I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.) Are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.) Like to play MST3K, the home game. See it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs.<br /><br />",0,ok  first of all  i am a huge zombie movie fan  i loved all of romeros flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re make of dawn of the dead  so when i had heard every single critic railing this movie i was still optimistic  i mean  critics hated resident evil  and while it may not be a particularly great film  i enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot em up with a half decent plot  this however  is pure crap  terrible dialogue  half assed plot  and video game scenes inserted into the film  who in their right mind thought that was a good idea  the only thing about this movie  i use the term loosely  that i enjoyed was jurgen prochnow as captain kirk  ugh   while his name throws originality out the window  you can see in his performance that he knows hes in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it  everyone else acts as if theyre doing shakespeare  and very badly i might add  basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a   are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b   like to play mst3k  the home game  see it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs 
"""Cut"" is a film about some film students making a film. It's very much in the ""Scream"" mold, an ironic, self-referential horror flick which, for me at least, falls down because for all its irony, it's still just a bad horror film, same as the films its referring to.<br /><br />But it was not without its charms. Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt, bitchy American actress hating every minute of working with the amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn't an act, although everyone involved with ""Cut"" says she was lovely to work with. :-)<br /><br />Seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or snapping was great. Everyone else, however, wavered between being OK and being terribly wooden.<br /><br />Anyway, ""Cut"" has some laughs, a few buckets of gore (some of it surprisingly gruesome), and ultimately is.. just another bad horror film.",0, cut  is a film about some film students making a film  its very much in the  scream  mold  an ironic  self referential horror flick which  for me at least  falls down because for all its irony  its still just a bad horror film  same as the films its referring to  but it was not without its charms  well  one charm anyway  molly ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt  bitchy american actress hating every minute of working with the amateur australian film crew  she was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasnt an act  although everyone involved with  cut  says she was lovely to work with      seriously  every scene of her pouting  sulking or snapping was great  everyone else  however  wavered between being ok and being terribly wooden  anyway   cut  has some laughs  a few buckets of gore  some of it surprisingly gruesome   and ultimately is   just another bad horror film 
"I started to watch this movie expecting nothing, just another movie to watch, but since the first twenty minutes, the artwork and main character, who is enigmatic, doesn't talk much, really got me in this movie.<br /><br />I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully acted and really touching. It's a bit slow but the immersion was complete. The directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars.

"i searched video store everywhere to find this movie, being the huge elvis fan that i am, and i found it to be a huge disappointment. kurt russel had most of the ""elvis moves"" down and the voice imitation was great, but the dubbed in singing voice of elvis just didnt work for me. the voice didnt always match up with russels mouth, and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable. also, there were so many freaking discrepancies in the film, people who dont know much about elvis would probably think them to be facts. songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life, the time when he got his first guitar is wrong, im pretty sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave, not one with a huge headstone reading JESSE GARRON. i know it was just a tv movie, but they skipped over important events, like the come-back-special, and dragged some scenes out for way too long. if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in his prime rent THATS THE WAY IT IS, or another elvis concert. hearing and seeing the real elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent.

"""They All Laughed"" is one of those little movies I am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past, but seems more contemporary. Even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet, that reality never brings it crashing down to earth. But, that said, this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going, and ""TAL"" is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale. It is a movie that wouldn't linger so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast: Colleen Camp's simultaneously shouting orders at John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat; and especially the moment Dorothy Stratten falls for John Ritter and says, ""How...weird."" It's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one's face.",1, they all laughed  is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary  it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past  but seems more contemporary  even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesnt date it too much  bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet  that reality never brings it crashing down to earth  but  that said  this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going  and  tal  is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale  it is a movie that wouldnt linger so long in the memory if it werent for the little moments provided by the excellent cast  colleen camps simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog  blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat  and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says   how   weird   its such a piece of fluff one doesnt want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it  but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on ones face 
"One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs help.<br /><br />It all comes down to loving people.

"Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution. One always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary. If you can put aside Rohmer's unabashed defense of the monarchy (and that is not an easy thing to do, given that, for instance, the French lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts), this is actually an elegant, intelligent and polished movie. Lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century France, Rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards. It is a blatantly artificial conceit, but it somehow works. And newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be.",1,rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot  an englishwoman who stayed in france during the apex of the french revolution  one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative  but who knew he was such a red blooded reactionary  if you can put aside rohmers unabashed defense of the monarchy  and that is not an easy thing to do  given that  for instance  the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts   this is actually an elegant  intelligent and polished movie  lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century france  rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards  it is a blatantly artificial conceit  but it somehow works  and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldnt be 
"It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, ""Cat's Meow"" and all his early ones from ""Targets"" to ""Nickleodeon"". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called ""Moonlighting"" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain't no ""Paper Moon"" and only a very pale version of ""What's Up, Doc"".",0,it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter  ben gazarra and audrey hepburn  they looked quite wonderful  but that was it  they were not given any characters or good lines to work with  i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing  some of the smaller female roles were fine  patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts  they showed some talent and it is sad they didnt go on to star in more and better films  sadly  i didnt think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role  the film appears to have some fans  and i was very open minded when i started watching it  i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie   cats meow  and all his early ones from  targets  to  nickleodeon   so  it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one  it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other  five years later  bogdanovichs ex girlfriend  cybil shepherd had a hit television series called  moonlighting  stealing the story idea from bogdanovich  of course  there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue  while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines  bottom line  it aint no  paper moon  and only a very pale version of  whats up  doc  
"I love this movie. It's wacky, funny, violent, surreal, played out in a madman's head, and definitely not your usual comedy. <br /><br />If you don't find the film amusing then I guess it's just not for your tastes, so this is a tough one to write a review for.<br /><br />For reference, some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Zoolander (that one only got me the second time around). There are others, but my taste is definitely for the unusual, and I am willing to accept that most people just don't tend to like that kind of thing. I make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour - at least I have one.<br /><br />The scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together, the verbal humour is hilarious, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as you would expect of the cast), though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high.

"So, back when Herbie made his first appearance, I was perfectly happy watching Dean Jones mug away. I only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations of a riveting/delightful story whenever I watch a movie, if I'm not on some sort of medication. And this is another good movie for the medicated. There are no major laughs, no complex plot lines, no difficult twists. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the fully loaded.<br /><br />This was the first time I had seen La Lohan on the screen since she swapped places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was excellent in that), and I can't say I was terribly impressed this time around. Aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color, she just didn't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers. Her 'need for speed' wasn't portrayed consistently in the film - perhaps it was elsewhere - she looked older than her part, and seemed to always be looking for something (a party? designer togs? new place to spend money?) off set. I couldn't see any chemistry with Justin Long; that romance seemed obligatory at best. The only time Lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon, who I thought was appropriately over the top as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy.<br /><br />It was great to see Herbie again, and I loved the movie intro with material from the old movies. If Disney had popped out with some Car 53 jewelry, I might have worn some just to be loyal. His new feature (?) was a little inconsistent (does he channel the thoughts of his driver? Does he now skateboard?) but whatever. We all knew how it was going to end, but I do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than Maggie. And my head still hurts from that lesson Maggie and we viewers had hammered home. <br /><br />What would have made the movie worthwhile? Have the old Herbie in a real story with a real plot - at the very least, Herbie's as good as Lassie - but clearly that's asking too much. Why is it that Disney always goes back to the same well as ""Herbie Goes Bananas"" and ""the Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes"" when it comes to innovation? <br /><br />I'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations. For the rest of us....it's for when you have the 'flu and just can't take the suspense of Rear Window.",0,so  back when herbie made his first appearance  i was perfectly happy watching dean jones mug away  i only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn  now  unfortunately  i have expectations of a riveting delightful story whenever i watch a movie  if im not on some sort of medication  and this is another good movie for the medicated  there are no major laughs  no complex plot lines  no difficult twists  herbie fully loaded is great for the fully loaded  this was the first time i had seen la lohan on the screen since she swapped places with jamie lee curtis  i thought she was excellent in that   and i cant say i was terribly impressed this time around  aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color  she just didnt ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers  her need for speed wasnt portrayed consistently in the film   perhaps it was elsewhere   she looked older than her part  and seemed to always be looking for something  a party  designer togs  new place to spend money   off set  i couldnt see any chemistry with justin long  that romance seemed obligatory at best  the only time lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with matt dillon  who i thought was appropriately over the top as evil bad guy trip murphy  it was great to see herbie again  and i loved the movie intro with material from the old movies  if disney had popped out with some car 53 jewelry  i might have worn some just to be loyal  his new feature     was a little inconsistent  does he channel the thoughts of his driver  does he now skateboard   but whatever  we all knew how it was going to end  but i do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than maggie  and my head still hurts from that lesson maggie and we viewers had hammered home   what would have made the movie worthwhile  have the old herbie in a real story with a real plot   at the very least  herbies as good as lassie   but clearly thats asking too much  why is it that disney always goes back to the same well as  herbie goes bananas  and  the computer that wore tennis shoes  when it comes to innovation   im sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations  for the rest of us    its for when you have the flu and just cant take the suspense of rear window 
"Having never heard of this film until I saw the rental DVD I as a bit sceptical, there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that can't do anything film a bad script, and in some cases don't seem to care.<br /><br />Well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release, it IS good. The story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry. I was pleasantly surprised at how good a job Justin Timberlake does here too with such a major role, OK he's not Oscar material yet, but he'll learn with each role and he shows a LOT of promise for the future here. Dylan McDermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie.<br /><br />Ultimately, just give it a go. you won't be disappointed, you won't be bored, in fact, I think you'll be more than happy with the end result.",1,having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical  there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that cant do anything film a bad script  and in some cases dont seem to care  well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release  it is good  the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry  i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role  ok hes not oscar material yet  but hell learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here  dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie  ultimately  just give it a go  you wont be disappointed  you wont be bored  in fact  i think youll be more than happy with the end result 
"Evidently lots of people really like this, but I found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers, especially the opener (but there's a marked dip in invention later on). I don't get on with Monroe - she's supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ain't that dumb, but she just comes over as dumb. Russell can't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium, but is otherwise rather wonderful. The men are staggeringly uninteresting, as is the plot. By no means atrocious, but so patchy that, if this is a classic, God help us all.",0,evidently lots of people really like this  but i found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop  saved from oblivion by jane russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers  especially the opener  but theres a marked dip in invention later on   i dont get on with monroe   shes supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who aint that dumb  but she just comes over as dumb  russell cant quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium  but is otherwise rather wonderful  the men are staggeringly uninteresting  as is the plot  by no means atrocious  but so patchy that  if this is a classic  god help us all 
"This movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a Mom (lisa Hartman Black) who acts like a man would in an action thriller. Unlike other movies where the focus is on the Police, here the Mom is tracking down her ex-husband who kidnapped their son. She gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her.<br /><br />Before finally catching up with her son, a lot of bizarre things happen. The Mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local Children's Play at a community theater. She gets caught, and then realizes it is not her child. That alone would have gotten most people put into the Mental Ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial. However, in this movie the Mom is release after a couple of hours because the victim's parents feel sorry for her. A little while later Mom breaks into her mother-in-law's house and then the Police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her (and feel sorry for her?).<br /><br />At another point in the story they have found the child, but when the Police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the Dad kept around just for such an emergency escape! The Mom gets someone to lend her a raft, and even though it must have taken some time (in a real world), she and the lawyer-boyfriend, and the Police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall. Instead of getting out of the raft to search for the Dad on the land, Mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life-jacket.

"I only rented this because i loved the first movie. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it.

"The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional (for him) role. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It's true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble - his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings. So Hanks took a role I wouldn't have expected him in, and he pulled it off well.<br /><br />Hanks' good performance aside, though, I certainly couldn't call this an enjoyable movie. After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic (it wasn't entirely clear to me for a while where this was going) it turns into a very sombre movie, about the complicated relationships Sullivan has developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney (Paul Newman), who's a sort of mob boss, and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them ""clean"" so to speak; isolated from his business. After the older son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, gets the wrong son (and the mother), and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a weird sort of father/son bonding movie.<br /><br />Although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of the story) it's really very dark throughout, that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall. I have to confess that while I appreciated Hanks' performance, the movie as a whole just didn't pull me in. 4/10",0,the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt tom hanks  as mike sullivan  he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional  for him  role  hanks is usually the good guy in a movie   the one you like  admire and root for  sullivan was definitely not a good guy  its true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble   his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son  even so  he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings  so hanks took a role i wouldnt have expected him in  and he pulled it off well  hanks good performance aside  though  i certainly couldnt call this an enjoyable movie  after an opening that i would best describe as enigmatic  it wasnt entirely clear to me for a while where this was going  it turns into a very sombre movie  about the complicated relationships sullivan has developed as a gangster   largely raised by rooney  paul newman   whos a sort of mob boss  and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them  clean  so to speak  isolated from his business  after the older son witnesses a murder  the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet  gets the wrong son  and the mother   and leaves sullivan and his older son  mike  jr   on the run  it becomes a weird sort of father son bonding movie  although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note  at least in the overall context of the story  its really very dark throughout  that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall  i have to confess that while i appreciated hanks performance  the movie as a whole just didnt pull me in  4 10
"The first time I saw this ""film"" I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in the music and dancing. As I've grown older, I've become more interested in the acting as well. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from the Jackson 5 up to ""Bad""), it was still entertaining to watch. The ""Badder"" sequence could've been left out, though the kids were pretty good. ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" were funny, especially when the police officer tells Michael, ""I need your autograph right here"", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. But it's ""Smooth Criminal"" that's the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did an excellent job as the toughie (and that hair was wild). The dancing is perfect, and so are the special effects. The only thing I could have done without was the spiders. Any fan of Michael's should see this, if you haven't already. I give it a 10+!",1,the first time i saw this  film  i loved it  when i was 11  i was more interested in the music and dancing  as ive grown older  ive become more interested in the acting as well  while the first half is just a retrospective of michaels career  from the jackson 5 up to  bad    it was still entertaining to watch  the  badder  sequence couldve been left out  though the kids were pretty good   speed demon  and  leave me alone  were funny  especially when the police officer tells michael   i need your autograph right here   after stopping him for dancing in a no dancing zone  but its  smooth criminal  thats the icing on the cake  joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie  and that hair was wild   the dancing is perfect  and so are the special effects  the only thing i could have done without was the spiders  any fan of michaels should see this  if you havent already  i give it a 10  
"The story-line of ""The Thief of Bagdad"" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together. The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas. He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffar's deeds and hate him. He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief. The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra. There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by. Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. Then he is captured. When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog. Jaffar then asks for the Princess's hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra. The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog. The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. He does awaken her. She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard. She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmad's sight and turn Abu back into a thief. The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island. Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. For freeing him, he gets three wishes. His first is for sausages. In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death. Abu makes a second wish, to find Ahmad. The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the All-Seeing eye. Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess's statue. Abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees Ahmad in a canyon. He has the genie take him to Ahmad. Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. She smells a flower and forgets everything at once. Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad. Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the 'eye'. Abu finds himself in the ""Land of Legend"", where the old men who rule want to make him their king. He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess. The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution. Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him. Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be. This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda. The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography. The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating. The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong, Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes. The production, apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors, I claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar. Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima, and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan. As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role. This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also. Its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements. This is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.",1,the story line of  the thief of bagdad  is complex  owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together  the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas  he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffars deeds and hate him  he is imprisoned by jaffar  where he meets abu the young thief  the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra  there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by  ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden  he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss  then he is captured  when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself  ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog  jaffar then asks for the princesss hand  and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra  the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace  accompanied by abu as his dog  the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her  so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog  in hopes the prince can rouse her  he does awaken her  she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad  but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard  she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms  on his promise to restore ahmads sight and turn abu back into a thief  the princess sees a vision of ahmad  he is in a boat  jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island  abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle  abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel  then corks him in again  for freeing him  he gets three wishes  his first is for sausages  in the meanwhile  the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar  but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy  one of whose six arms stabs him to death  abu makes a second wish  to find ahmad  the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all seeing eye  abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye  battling a giant spider  then scaling the goddesss statue  abu gazes into the eye and sees ahmad in a canyon  he has the genie take him to ahmad  ahmad uses the eye to see the princess  she smells a flower and forgets everything at once  abu wishes they were in bagdad  but the genie laughs and leaves  jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him  omitting mention of ahmad  ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess  but jaffar smashes the eye  abu finds himself in the  land of legend   where the old men who rule want to make him their king  he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead  to hurry to save ahmad and the princess  the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner  using his bow from the flying carpet  to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution  jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse  but another shot from the bow finishes him  ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess  but when he tries to make abu his vizier  the young thief refuses  saying that what he wants is adventure  not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be  this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda  the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director  while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography  the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell  with tim whelan  alexander korda  william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating  the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong  oliver messel and marcel vertes  the production  apart from its gorgeous and expensive looking visual splendors  i claim is dominated by two other elements  the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar  rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent  plus his usual intelligence and power  june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima  and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan  as ahmad  john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some  he is memorably good in his winning role  this film has a spaciousness about it that is found  i assert  in other korda works also  its imaginative content stands in contrast to very strong realistic sets  costumes and set design elements  this is one of the most memorable idea level fantasies of all time  worthy to be enjoyed over and over 
"Good story and excellent animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi are obvious, and that's a good thing. Anyone that enjoys Conan the Barbarian or the game Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral. Most often in fantasy movies Elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone familiar with Frazetta's, Bakshi's, or even Tolkien's work know they are not racist. Anyone that enjoys Fantasy movies should like this movie. It is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo. The casting was well done and the scenes and music are first rate. I hope someone puts this gem on DVD soon.

"This is the biggest Flop of 2008. I don know what Director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster. The songs have been added without situations, the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish... Akki is also done a good job....

"I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The opening moments, with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter, Diana, about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art, give the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy-vampire flick. Turns out this initial impression turns out false. Oh, Troma, the mark of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk-food craft (or, sometimes not). This is a case where it's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor (i.e. the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian who does Jimmy Durante impressions?) are weak at best, and any unintentional laughs are undercut by Sergio Lapel's bargain basement direction.<br /><br />And it's not without him trying, oh Lord no. He does try a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for lights, sure, but the way they're used in the movie made I, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulking in my seat: if I saw this in a theater I would have to blind my eyes in many instances, and would wonder whether or not his DP understood really the basic 3-point lighting set-up. While this, along with a very lackluster sound design (or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene), shouldn't be something that comes to attention during a Troma release, it should be something *basic* that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn't very funny or scary (and it isn't) or if Lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments.<br /><br />It's not a good movie by any stretch, and perhaps if you're a vampire die-hard (or just a vampire period) it might have some appeal as a low-rent bargain basement alternative to Near Dark, or as a slight improvement over, say, 1972's Blood Freak.

"I'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile. I love to praise a great movie and I'm not biased toward ""male"" movies. Legally blonde was an excellent film. Georgia Rule on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of movie making at its worst. by the end of the film I didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved. <br /><br />The most important thing in a film is a good STORY. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject matter is deep, doesn't mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change, and is primed for that change over the course of the movie. In Georgia Rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time (you've only got a couple hours in a movie). That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written story, and the litter of weak dynamic characters, I can't even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. That's fine if your're writing American Beauty but not when you're attempting a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no I'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested, crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions). The ""Dudley Do Right"" Mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments...and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who's been molested just stay over occasionally (unless he's an actor or a politician).

"I attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations: <br /><br />1. Just because you've directed a ton of music videos DOES NOT make you qualified to make movies. The movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense, horrible angles, and terrible lighting. The editing didn't help this mess at all. When ""Dixie"" shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but it's never clear what the heck she's talking about.<br /><br />2. The plot had promise, but the script was thin and full of Ford Truck sized holes. We never get to understand what drives the characters, what's really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them. Sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic. The deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés. (In fact, the whole town was one big cliché of southern life.) Half the audience groaned when Toby drawled ""Ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurl""...and we were treated to that insipid line not once, but TWICE! The revelations were yawn inducing, and the dramatic confessions boiled down to ""I was stupid and stubborn"".<br /><br />3. The acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with. Toby was dark and brooding most of the film, but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming. It's a shame he didn't have more screen time like that. Kelly Preston's acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows. Lindsay Haun is talented and it's certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you don't blame her father for not coming to look for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost. (And indeed, their characters get lost in this film!) <br /><br />4. If you're a Toby fan you'll love the songs. But often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songs--or the artists on his record label. For instance, the movie's official love song is ""Crash Here Tonight"". You'd think that would play around a tender love scene, but nope...we hear about 45 seconds of it as he's heading to a memorial service. It was as if they said ""well, we gotta use this song somewhere"". The song ""Broken"" is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie.<br /><br />In summary...a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for Toby Keith's music and product placement for Ford Trucks. It goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video. I like Toby and really wanted to like ""Broken Bridges"" but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where.",0,i attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations   1  just because youve directed a ton of music videos does not make you qualified to make movies  the movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense  horrible angles  and terrible lighting  the editing didnt help this mess at all  when  dixie  shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but its never clear what the heck shes talking about  2  the plot had promise  but the script was thin and full of ford truck sized holes  we never get to understand what drives the characters  whats really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them  sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic  the deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés   in fact  the whole town was one big cliché of southern life   half the audience groaned when toby drawled  ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurl    and we were treated to that insipid line not once  but twice  the revelations were yawn inducing  and the dramatic confessions boiled down to  i was stupid and stubborn   3  the acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with  toby was dark and brooding most of the film  but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming  its a shame he didnt have more screen time like that  kelly prestons acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows  lindsay haun is talented and its certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you dont blame her father for not coming to look for her  burt reynolds and tess harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost   and indeed  their characters get lost in this film    4  if youre a toby fan youll love the songs  but often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songs  or the artists on his record label  for instance  the movies official love song is  crash here tonight   youd think that would play around a tender love scene  but nope   we hear about 45 seconds of it as hes heading to a memorial service  it was as if they said  well  we gotta use this song somewhere   the song  broken  is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie  in summary   a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for toby keiths music and product placement for ford trucks  it goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video  i like toby and really wanted to like  broken bridges  but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where 
"""Yes, Georgio"" is a light-hearted and enjoyable movie/comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once. Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti, they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Although, a full opera might be a better representation of Pavarotti's operatic talents, oftentimes, an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. ""Yes, Georgio"" permits Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not.<br /><br />Many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable; I don't agree. Enormously talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. Additionally, people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other.<br /><br />Relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. The ending scenes from Puccini's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there.",1, yes  georgio  is a light hearted and enjoyable movie comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music  its not my favorite movie but it is a movie i have enjoyed seeing more than once  some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy pavarotti  they would likely be better served by picking up an opera dvd  although  a full opera might be a better representation of pavarottis operatic talents  oftentimes  an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person   yes  georgio  permits pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not  many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable  i dont agree  enormously talented people can be both self centered and charming   charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people  additionally  people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own  both georgio and pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other  relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities  the ending scenes from puccinis turandot alone are worth the time to get there 
"Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. The movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things, it just tells us a story, one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters, it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again, feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry at times, it will shock you and comfort you, it will give you and take from you. Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life, and that of my friends, and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours.",1,radiofreccia is a movie about all of us  about our dreams  our friends  our obsessions  our addictions  our fears  it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century  the movie doesnt take a happy or sad approach on things  it just tells us a story  one that all of us could have experienced  one of happiness and excitement  sadness and grief  the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters  it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again  feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place  hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends  listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international  playing their dreams  our dreams  radiofreccia will make you laugh  it will make you cry at times  it will shock you and comfort you  it will give you and take from you  personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life  and that of my friends  and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours

"This movie is AWESOME. I watched it the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was alright, but i think it RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart. He made a movie totally unlike those terrible Hollywood films, like the Matrix and STop or my Mom will Shoot. It could have been better, though. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like that big talon that the funny man wears. I think he's the coolest guy since that Domino Pizza claymation guy. Not only does this movie look really cool, like those out-of-focus movies my dad made of my birthday when I turned 6. BUt it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated, but they all meet up in the end. It's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up. I wish Ted V. Mikels would make a sequel. But it needs more aliens. And a pirate.",0,this movie is awesome  i watched it the other day with my cousin jay jay  he said it was alright  but i think it rulezzz  i mean  its so cool  ted v  mikels is so brave and smart  he made a movie totally unlike those terrible hollywood films  like the matrix and stop or my mom will shoot  it could have been better  though  i like ninjas and pirates  i also like that big talon that the funny man wears  i think hes the coolest guy since that domino pizza claymation guy  not only does this movie look really cool  like those out of focus movies my dad made of my birthday when i turned 6  but it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated  but they all meet up in the end  its genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up  i wish ted v  mikels would make a sequel  but it needs more aliens  and a pirate 
"Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays at Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time big egotistical star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture. In a panic the studio hires lookalike Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to impersonate her and have Bowers take her to the premiere NOT telling him it's not Marshall. Naturally they fall in love. You can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself.<br /><br />The plot is old (to put it nicely) but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices. The score is good (highlighted by ""Hooray for Hollywood"") and director Busby Berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy doing his patented slow burn). Also Glenda Farrell has a few funny bits as Monas sister Jonesie.<br /><br />Still the movie isn't that good. The rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny. Lola Lane especially is just lousy trying to play Mona for comedy. Also there is racism--a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there's some truly appalling racist ""humor"" at one point. That's probably what keeps this off TV most of the time. I realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today.<br /><br />All in all a so-so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs.

"This one took me by surprise because i had often been disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past, but he caught the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding both farce and pathos while delivering humour and real emotions. The always-wonderful Julie Waters is terrific here, and anyone who has not yet scene her in 1983's Educating Rita should rent it immediately (marvelous film). The rest of the supporting characters are well-played as well, many marvelously eccentric without going over the top.

"This movie is awful. At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back. The ""twist"" ending is very contrived. The character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation-- with the premise that the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve-- is explained away in literally ninety seconds of ""No we were just tricking you."" Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset about it! ""I will forgive you if you can forgive me,"" is as upset as he gets. If someone took weeks to convince me I was about to die and then said ""No, sorry , just fooling you"" I would raise some serious hell.

"This film was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with performances from ""the next generation of beautiful losers"" are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright's) or bland under-achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony got within striking distance of Leonard's own versions by using a little restraint. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film- like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots, shaky blurred camera work, use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen's comments (making it harder to hear what's being said) and a spooky, pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments (an attempt at added gravitas?).

"Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers.<br /><br />However, I really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and Nichols' Closer. One scene especially where Adrian Grenier's character is questioning Rosario Dawson's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen's character is questioning Julia Roberts, although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in ""Love."" Also note that ""Anna"" is the name of both Dawson's and Roberts' character. Can't be coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's ""Reigen"" so I'm not sure how this connection formed.<br /><br />Anyone have an idea?",1,overall  i enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers  however  i really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and nichols closer  one scene especially where adrian greniers character is questioning rosario dawsons about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in closer where clive owens character is questioning julia roberts  although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in  love   also note that  anna  is the name of both dawsons and roberts character  cant be coincidence  now closer is based on patrick marbers play and supposedly this film is loosely based on arthur schnitzlers  reigen  so im not sure how this connection formed  anyone have an idea 
"Musically speaking Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another pluperfect musical after Top Hat if that was possible. Although in this case like that Jerome Kern confection Roberta that they were in, Follow the Fleet retained Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard.<br /><br />Randolph Scott is a career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who enlisted in the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers his former partner. But now the two are on shore leave. Fred and Ginger take up right where they left off, and Randy accidentally meets Ginger's dowdy sister Harriet who blossoms into a real beauty. But Randy's a typical love 'em and leave 'em sailor. <br /><br />Again Irving Berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production. Ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with Let Yourself Go which she and Fred later dance to. But the real hit of the show is Let's Face the Music and Dance which is a number done at a Navy show. Sung first by Astaire and later danced to by the pair, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dancing on this one is absolute magic.<br /><br />I'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was. But they will know immediately when I mention her in conjunction with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. That's right Ozzie and Harriet. It's something of a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David and Ricky's mom on television. Then again she didn't even keep her own name. <br /><br />Neither Ozzie or Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really carry a tune. She sings Get Thee Behind Me Satan and The Moon and I Are Here, But Where Are You, both with real feeling and class. I recommend you see Follow the Fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of Harriet Hilliard incredibly forgotten today.",1,musically speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another pluperfect musical after top hat if that was possible  although in this case like that jerome kern confection roberta that they were in  follow the fleet retained randolph scott with another singer  this time harriet hilliard  randolph scott is a career navy cpo and fred astaire is an ex vaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner  but now the two are on shore leave  fred and ginger take up right where they left off  and randy accidentally meets gingers dowdy sister harriet who blossoms into a real beauty  but randys a typical love em and leave em sailor   again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production  ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to  but the real hit of the show is lets face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show  sung first by astaire and later danced to by the pair  lets face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen  their dancing on this one is absolute magic  im sure that when i mention harriet hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was  but they will know immediately when i mention her in conjunction with her famous husband ozzie nelson  thats right ozzie and harriet  its something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and rickys mom on television  then again she didnt even keep her own name   neither ozzie or harriet sang on television  ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer  but harriet could really carry a tune  she sings get thee behind me satan and the moon and i are here  but where are you  both with real feeling and class  i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet hilliard incredibly forgotten today 
"It's easy to make really general comments about a film like this. The fact that it's one of the only remaining Japanese films from this era causes people to say that it ""started Japanese cinema"" and was ""unlike anything the west ever made."" The latter of these two comments is particularly false as Kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off ""Caligari"" on more than one occasion. But style was meant to be imitated, and doesn't take away from this film's importance. What we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles, opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities. For this purpose, the madhouse is the ideal setting, and the writers knew this. This is a landmark film, and every effort should be made to track it down.<br /><br />5 out of 5 - Essential",1,its easy to make really general comments about a film like this  the fact that its one of the only remaining japanese films from this era causes people to say that it  started japanese cinema  and was  unlike anything the west ever made   the latter of these two comments is particularly false as kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off  caligari  on more than one occasion  but style was meant to be imitated  and doesnt take away from this films importance  what we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles  opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities  for this purpose  the madhouse is the ideal setting  and the writers knew this  this is a landmark film  and every effort should be made to track it down  5 out of 5   essential
"Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. It is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break. I've beaten the game 4 times, but I've never gotten all 120 stars...(I've gotten 111)...but I hope to achieve them eventually. Even though I didn't officially play this game until I was seven in, I loved watching my sisters play it. Now I am 13 and still play this, erasing games and starting over again.<br /><br />The graphics are unbelievable for an early N64 game. The gameplay is addictive. The controls are great. The levels are tough, but not impossible. The Bowser fights are challenging.<br /><br />I would like to tell you more, but why don't you just get it for yourself?

"Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon Earth. Being gay, their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay. Hence, when they discover women or ""female creatures"" live on Earth, they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population.<br /><br />An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist storyline, albeit probably intended as a satire, give this film some shock value. However, there's little substance underneath. As another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes besides the characters' names (eg. ArmInAss); I think I laughed once at one small gay joke. I think I got the point of the film quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had had enough; I kept wanting the film to end already (and it is a short film!).

"Can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal, which was to correctly adapt Allende's novel? Obviously yes. Bille August managed to make a superficial, shallow film where basic elements of South American mentality are presented simply as side events, resulting in total incoherency.

"This film reminds me of 42nd Street starring Bebe Daniels and Ruby Keeler. When I watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd Street, especially the character Eloise who's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle, like Bebe Daniels did in 42nd Street and another performer gets the part and become a star. This film, like most race films, keeps people watching because of the great entertainment. Race films always showed Black Entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era. The Dancing Styles, The Music, Dressing Styles, You'll Love It. This movie could of been big if it was made in Hollywood, it would of had better scenery, better filming, and more money which would make any movie better. But its worth watching because it is good and Micheaux does good with the little he has. I have to say out of all Micheaux's films, Swing is the best! The movie features singers, dancers, actresses, and actors who were popular but forgotten today. Doli Armena, a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think Gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky. The sexy, hot female dancer Consuela Harris would put Ann Miller and Gyspy Rose Lee to shame.<br /><br />Adding further info... Popular blues singer of the 20's and 30's Cora Green is the focus of the film, she's Mandy, a good, hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women. A nosy neighbor played by Amanda Randolph tells Mandy what she seen and heard and Mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive, curvy woman by the name of Eloise (played Hazel Diaz, a Hot-Cha entertainer in the 30's) and a fight breaks out. Then Mandy goes to Harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel Lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies Dorothy Van Engle. Lena provides Mandy with a home, a job, and helps her become a star when temperamental Cora Smith (played by Hazel, I guess she's playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name) tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior. When Cora gets drunk and breaks her leg, Lena convinces everyone that Mandy is right for the job and Lena is right and a star is born in Mandy. Tall, long, lanky, but handsome Carman Newsome is the cool aspiring producer who Lena looks out for as well. Pretty boy Larry Seymour plays the no good man but after Lena threatens him, he might shape up. There are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where Cora Smith (Hazel Diaz) struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that's not enough, she almost gets into a fight with Mandy again. In between there's great entertainment by chorus girls, tap dancers, shake dancers, swing music, and blues singing. There's even white people watching the entertainment, I wonder where Micheaux found them, there's even a scene where there's blacks and whites sitting together at the club, Micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films, he should be commended for such a bold move.<br /><br />This movie was the first race film I really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to Oscar Micheaux. This movie is one of the best of the race film genre, its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business.<br /><br />No these early race films may not be the best, can't be compared with Hallelujah, Green Pastures, Stormy Weather, Cabin In The Sky, Carmen Jones, or any other Hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film-making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person's eyes. These films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life, be beautiful, classy, and elegant, and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in Hollywood. Most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren't the best, but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time, Micheaux and Spencer Williams couldn't afford Nina Mae McKinney, Josephine Baker, Ethel Waters, Fredi Washington, Paul Robeson, Rex Ingram, and more of the bigger stars, so Micheaux and other black and white race film-makers would use nightclub performers in their movies, some were good, some weren't great actors and actresses, but I think Micheaux and others knew most weren't good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent, they just wanted their stories told, and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films. For some true actors/actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work, especially if they didn't want to play Hollywood stereotypes, so I think you'll be able to spot the true actors/actresses from the nightclub performers. These race films are very historic, they could have been lost forever, many are lost, maybe race films aren't the greatest example of cinema but even Hollywood films didn't start out great in the beginning. I think if the race film genre continued, it would have better. If your looking for great acting, most race films aren't the ones, but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films, than watch race films. There are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast, Moon Over Harlem, Body and Soul, Paradise In Harlem, Keep Punching, Sunday Sinners, Dark Manhattan, Broken Strings, Boy! What A Girl, Mystery In Swing, Miracle In Harlem, and Sepia Cinderella, that not only has good entertainment but good acting.",1,this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby

30s  and a fight breaks out  then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle  lena provides mandy with a home  a job  and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith  played by hazel  i guess shes playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name  tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior  when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg  lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy  tall  long  lanky  but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well  pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him  he might shape up  there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith  hazel diaz  struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but thats not enough  she almost gets into a fight with mandy again  in between theres great entertainment by chorus girls  tap dancers  shake dancers  swing music  and blues singing  theres even white people watching the entertainment  i wonder where micheaux found them  theres even a scene where theres blacks and whites sitting together at the club  micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films  he should be commended for such a bold move  this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux  this movie is one of the best of the race film genre  its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business  no these early race films may not be the best  cant be compared with hallelujah  green pastures  stormy weather  cabin in the sky  carmen jones  or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black persons eyes  these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life  be beautiful  classy  and elegant  and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood  most of the actors and actresses of these race films werent the best  but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time  micheaux and spencer williams couldnt afford nina mae mckinney  josephine baker  ethel waters  fredi washington  paul robeson  rex ingram  and more of the bigger stars  so micheaux and other black and white race film makers would use nightclub performers in their movies  some were good  some werent great actors and actresses  but i think micheaux and others knew most werent good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent  they just wanted their stories told  and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films  for some true actors actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work  especially if they didnt want to play hollywood stereotypes  so i think youll be able to spot the true actors actresses from the nightclub performers  these race films are very historic  they could have been lost forever  many are lost  maybe race films arent the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didnt start out great in the beginning  i think if the race film genre continued  it would have better  if your looking for great acting  most race films arent the ones  but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films  than watch race films  there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast  moon over harlem  body and soul  paradise in harlem  keep punching  sunday sinners  dark manhattan  broken strings  boy  what a girl  mystery in swing  miracle in harlem  and sepia cinderella  that not only has good entertainment but good acting 
"I went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film. What I got was scare after scare. It's a horror film at it's core. It's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore. This film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms... etc. After reading some of the external reviews I am really surprised that critics didn't like this film. I am going to see it again this week and am excited about it.<br /><br />I gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should. It scared the s**t out of me.",1,i went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film  what i got was scare after scare  its a horror film at its core  its not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore  this film doesnt even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters  i think one of the best things about the concept where its not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house  they become haunted no matter where they are  office buildings  police stations  hotel rooms    etc  after reading some of the external reviews i am really surprised that critics didnt like this film  i am going to see it again this week and am excited about it  i gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should  it scared the s  t out of me 
"I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not referring only to the breathtaking scenery. It's about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives. In the end four women total rent the place together, all with different personalities and different reasons for being there. In this magically beautiful place they all find the peace they're longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions, more so than without. I also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding. The acting is a joy to watch in itself. I especially love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).",1,i think this movie is absolutely beautiful  and im not referring only to the breathtaking scenery  its about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives  in the end four women total rent the place together  all with different personalities and different reasons for being there  in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace theyre longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions  more so than without  i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding  the acting is a joy to watch in itself  i especially love the characters of lottie  josie lawrence  and lady caroline  polly walker  
"This movie will not sit well with some, but it is a must view. I am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of HOW African American couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there as ""other"" African Americans moved in.<br /><br />(Minor Spoilers)<br /><br />This little Showtime film is almost like a Spike Lee Joint...you have an African American male (Danny Glover) who worked his way HARD through the traditionally white law profession positions in the 1970's. Like ANY American, he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot, there was still alot of problems going on. The only African Americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids. One owning a home? Wow.<br /><br />Then the blending in began. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to ""get involved"" so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do. And just when the man thinks he and his family are ""in"", right next door comes another African American who got in because they won the ""lotto"" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes and he wants nothing to do with them for he doesn't want the neighborhood to think they are alike. He, of course is of a better calibre, his new neighbor is ""ghetto"" not an shouldn't be there! Who's got a problem now?<br /><br />What this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in, and how they lose themselves in the process. It makes you question where does racism begin and end...and with whom. It shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have, you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you. It also shows how these African American children, when ""blending in"" neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture (complete with blonde hair and blue eyes, mind you!) around them. They laugh along with the jokes, not knowing they ARE the joke and not knowing..why.<br /><br />But overall, this film is about 'people'. No matter what race you are, this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other...all for the sake of fitting in..all because you feel you have more money than others, so that automatically makes you better -- and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you.<br /><br />Again, NOT for everyone. But take a look and judge for yourself.<br /><br />",1,this movie will not sit well with some  but it is a must view  i am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of how african american couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there as  other  african americans moved in   minor spoilers  this little showtime film is almost like a spike lee joint   you have an african american male  danny glover  who worked his way hard through the traditionally white law profession positions in the 1970s  like any american  he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot  there was still alot of problems going on  the only african americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids  one owning a home  wow  then the blending in began  his wife  whoopi goldberg  is told to  get involved  so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do  and just when the man thinks he and his family are  in   right next door comes another african american who got in because they won the  lotto   monique   and in his eyes and he wants nothing to do with them for he doesnt want the neighborhood to think they are alike  he  of course is of a better calibre  his new neighbor is  ghetto  not an shouldnt be there  whos got a problem now  what this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in  and how they lose themselves in the process  it makes you question where does racism begin and end   and with whom  it shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have  you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you  it also shows how these african american children  when  blending in  neighborhoods such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture  complete with blonde hair and blue eyes  mind you   around them  they laugh along with the jokes  not knowing they are the joke and not knowing  why  but overall  this film is about people  no matter what race you are  this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other   all for the sake of fitting in  all because you feel you have more money than others  so that automatically makes you better    and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you  again  not for everyone  but take a look and judge for yourself

"Eskimo is a serious movie about the cultural chasm between an indigenous population and the encroaching white man. Although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non-professionals, Eskimo is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to the final shot.<br /><br />The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than do the whalers that darken his landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his mate, it is natural that other men share their women with their friend. It is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse. All of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding Arctic setting. The trusting Eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers (with heavy European accents) that do not view these natives as their equals. Deceit, drunken orgies, rape, and death occur after the Eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas. Eventually the lead Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge. The audience would have cheered in the 1930's theaters.<br /><br />Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back Mala for trial. The Mounties are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case. Will the Mounties get their man? Is it fair to hold Mala to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society? Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the white man's law must prevail? Is there no hope for innocence?<br /><br />This is not a great movie, but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting. I suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was done before today's disclaimer that none were injured in the making of the film -- so beware of the raw nature sequences.

"Curiosity led me to this ""masterpiece"". Unfortunately, I didn't rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the makers of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave new meaning to the term ""finger lickin' good""! And with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards I had trouble following the story. All in all Jeremy Renner's performance wasn't too bad. You can catch him in ""S.W.A.T."", in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop. Anyway, I would rate this as a 1/10. It only got a 1 because of Renner's so-so performance. There are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering Dahmer's crimes.

"""Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the best films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come across it ever since. It is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - could find none. I would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy.",1, ko to tamo peva  is one of the best films i ever saw  a tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a god forsaken serbian province just before the start of the world war ii  i saw it in a small movie theater in russia where the film had had a very limited distribution  and i had no chance to come across it ever since  it is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now  i searched for a vhs or dvd copy of it many times  and alas   could find none  i would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy

I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I didn't recognise one person - this is refreshing, much like BSG. It has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can't wait for the series to start airing. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job. The special effects, dialogue and acting were all spot on, and I felt emotionally tied up in the storyline.

"I watched the Malayalam movie ""Boeing Boeing"" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an English movie of same name) long back. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way, the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal Hindi movies (probably the director did this to suit the taste of Hindi audience)... <br /><br />I haven't seen the English original. But had really enjoyed the Malayalam film (made by Priyadarshan himself)which was a side splitting comedy, back then. Of course the acting by Mohanlal,Mukesh and Sukumari (who did the cook's role) was so natural and spontaneous.<br /><br />Probably, I am too smitten by the Malayalam film that I cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its Hindi remake.

His performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are first-rate. (""You know what kind of songs he wrote?

"Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say to that is...are you kidding me? Come on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie I really didn't even notice it.<br /><br />You can tell that Damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a great supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization.<br /><br />Even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on.

"This was not enjoyable to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal (boring!) job just so his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides that he'll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead. A documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with snide captions. The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank appear dumb and pathetic, instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured.<br /><br />Essentially a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is.

"Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widower father David Niven holiday in the South of France with nutty Mylène Demongeot. Things are fine until family friend Deborah Kerr shows up. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of Kerr too hard to resist. That's fine with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as he's done with all the women in his past...including Demongeot). When it appears as though she's becoming second banana in Niven's life, Seberg exact revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes. The cinematography by Georges Périnal is stunning. The film features some of Preminger's least heavy-handed direction, although he rarely allows any close-ups, which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes (mostly involving bird-brained Demongeot). Seberg acquits herself fairly well, but Niven is at his least appealing...and he shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really mis-steps with that casting. It's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg's would-be suitor and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother. Juliette Gréco, playing herself, sings the title song in a Paris nightclub.

When she and the others leave the studio, the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress Curly up as Christine. The contract lady who can make Christine's career, sees Curly and mistakes him for Christine and invites Curly to sing for her party.

"Entertainment Tonight has been going down hill for the last few years, but as of last night (Aug 17th 2006) they reached a new low.<br /><br />In an effort to try to hype up their broadcast, they decided to post actual photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body in their teasers last night ...saying ""Pictures from the case you have never seen before"". The two photos were graphic and very disturbing. One was of the side of her face and head/neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck, and bruising on her face. This was so hideously awful, I could not believe it. How has this got to do with ANYTHING remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment?? Nothing!! They have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low....and it shows.

"This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump out at me: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple trees and brush. Not scary whatsoever. News flash, if you are filming in the Southern California area, big bear is only an hour away. They actually have trees there.<br /><br />2. The writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal, cliché, or just plain stupid. For instance the name of the camp is ""camp blood"" (lame), the name of the clown is ""the killer clown"" (lame). What is a clown doing in a forest anyway? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. The last but certainly the least was the acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting. Worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph. It's a really long scene and I guess she was supposed to be sexy, but she was NOT. Also, and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me, was this tool who is supposed to be ""athletic."" For instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them. Then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very ""girl like"" run, that he is quite far from athletic. Oh and to the girl who played Kat, good Lord stop singing. That song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself.<br /><br />If for some reason you do see this movie, I would at least recommend watching the special features. The group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story. In fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending. Apparently she hangs out with special kids.",0,this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen  here are the things that immediately jump out at me  1  the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush  not scary whatsoever  news flash  if you are filming in the southern california area  big bear is only an hour away  they actually have trees there  2  the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced  every possible line in the movie was unoriginal  cliché  or just plain stupid  for instance the name of the camp is  camp blood   lame   the name of the clown is  the killer clown   lame   what is a clown doing in a forest anyway  was that the only mask they could find  3  the last but certainly the least was the acting  absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled  a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting  worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph  its a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy  but she was not  also  and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me  was this tool who is supposed to be  athletic   for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them  then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very  girl like  run  that he is quite far from athletic  oh and to the girl who played kat  good lord stop singing  that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself  if for some reason you do see this movie  i would at least recommend watching the special features  the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story  in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending  apparently she hangs out with special kids 
"National Lampoon was once a funny magazine. Whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy coke-head days of the seventies (when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes) depends very much on your date of birth, but everyone agrees that by the early eighties, middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs hadn't, and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spin-off records shot further holes in the hull. Outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence, there's absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug. If you make it through the baffling opening segment, 'Growing Myself', hoping things will get better, tough luck - they don't. Whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess. If there's ever a global shortage of guitar picks, the negatives of this rambling, incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose.",0,national lampoon was once a funny magazine  whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy coke head days of the seventies  when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes  depends very much on your date of birth  but everyone agrees that by the early eighties  middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs hadnt  and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spin off records shot further holes in the hull  outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence  theres absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug  if you make it through the baffling opening segment  growing myself  hoping things will get better  tough luck   they dont  whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess  if theres ever a global shortage of guitar picks  the negatives of this rambling  incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose 
"This one is quite a nice surprise. Cute little story of the heroine's quest, very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy soon-to-be-spinster type into a raunchy DD-cup sex queen. <br /><br />Visually a sight for sore eyes, not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for (most of) the costumes and make-up of the actors. An unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation.<br /><br />Back to the positives: The movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera-shots which you would not expect in a soft core. Loved that scene with the icicles, absolute classics potential. A slight minus only for (very) few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief. <br /><br />9/10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect.",1,this one is quite a nice surprise  cute little story of the heroines quest  very surprising metamorphosis of the four eye prissy soon to be spinster type into a raunchy dd cup sex queen   visually a sight for sore eyes  not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for  most of  the costumes and make up of the actors  an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation  back to the positives  the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera shots which you would not expect in a soft core  loved that scene with the icicles  absolute classics potential  a slight minus only for  very  few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief   9 10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect 
"The Slackers as titled in this movie are three college friends Dave, Jeff and Sam(Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel respectively), who are about to graduate from university without sitting through an honest exam but making it end successfully. This continues until the very end when unlikeable but the most likable character of the movie Nathan(Schwartzman) figures out what they are up to. Nathan starts blackmailing in order to make up with his dream girl as he cant pursue that in normal conditions. The only problem is when the trio starts to work on it, Dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good hearted Angela(James King) Unfortunately, not a brilliant genre movie. Schwartzman makes to watch the movie easy as his performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was hired just to be around with her gorgeous look. The Slackers is reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. Jokes are as shallow as in American Pie. But aren't they all used? I think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality. Overall, a few smiley moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting(except for Schwartzman) and subject. * out of *****",0,the slackers as titled in this movie are three college friends dave  jeff and sam devon sawa  michael maronna and jason segel respectively   who are about to graduate from university without sitting through an honest exam but making it end successfully  this continues until the very end when unlikeable but the most likable character of the movie nathan schwartzman  figures out what they are up to  nathan starts blackmailing in order to make up with his dream girl as he cant pursue that in normal conditions  the only problem is when the trio starts to work on it  dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good hearted angela james king  unfortunately  not a brilliant genre movie  schwartzman makes to watch the movie easy as his performance is brilliant  kings performance is average  i think she was hired just to be around with her gorgeous look  the slackers is reminiscent of american pie with a different direction  jokes are as shallow as in american pie  but arent they all used  i think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality  overall  a few smiley moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting except for schwartzman  and subject    out of      
"This is probably the best television show I've ever seen. I first saw it on Comedy Central several years ago. At the time I was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order, and having just watched all three series in order and unedited (thank you internet and your wondrous ""series of tubes"") I am SO GLAD I rediscovered it! I think Comedy Central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a ""season""......and I tried to get friends and family to watch it, but nobody really seemed to like it (I need new friends). So, on my own, I made the best out of it that I could. Even when I felt like it was waning a bit, I still felt compelled to continue watching. Years after when I discovered Little Britain, I immediately recognized Pauline from LoG as having influenced Marjorie in Fat Fighters. Also, I love the idea of writers who act the entire show....(not new, but done impeccably here). LB has nothing on LoG! (No offense, Matt & David....Love you)! This is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius. Serial murder, implied cannibalism.....you name it and it's probably found in this wonderful, unique piece of TV art. The location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of Royston Vasey.....You'll Never Leave! I think my favorite character would have to be Tubbs, but each character as portrayed has it's own ""charm"". My least favorite was Papa Lazarous, that was until he re-surfaced in series three (clever and wholly unexpected)! It's best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as I said before, becomes so compelling (while repulsing) that you really CAN'T stop watching. This is not for those with weak stomachs, kids, conservatives or Grandma (unless you've got one saucy granny)! I have always loved British TV, particularly comedies, from Monty Python to Benny Hill, Red Dwarf to Keeping Up Appearances, Absolutely Fabulous and the British originals Coupling and The Office (but not their US counterparts....sorry). This is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between what's funny and what's just sick and twisted. Nothing, NOTHING on US TV has ever come close to this level of entertainment. US broadcast TV is so sad and lame, I can barely stand to watch ANY of it. It's kind of sad that even our cable channels don't have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem (your loss, Comedy Central). Thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the ""across the pond"" that redeem the entire medium every decade or so. Basic cable here in the US has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently ""crossing lines"" with more graphic sexual content, drug use and adult language, but they are still years away from just deciding to be Adults about showing real life, adult behavior (instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up, sheesh, it's like the same basic show format for the past 35 years)! Don't even get me started on US sitcoms! Waste of time and lots of wasted money......did you know that ""According to Jim"" has been on the air for 10 years??? 10 YEARS?? Anyway... Watch this show, get it on DVD, do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well! You've never seen anything like it. There are three specials that I have not watched yet....I'm saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits. He'll watch them, even if I have to chain him up and paint him with Excrement! Lines and lines and lines and lines! Note that series three departs from one and two....the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters, the laugh track is gone (thank bloody hell), the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of Royston Vasey. Don't be thrown by any of that as by the end, the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two. I think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable. Brilliant, confident and absolutely demented. You will want to re-watch it again and again. It's amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight-gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close-up facial expression. If ever I were to meet any of the writer/performers, I'd implore them not to recreate it or try to top it.....I'd just say ""Can I help you at all?"" (Then they'd probably slap me, so I'd ask them to sign the slap-mark)! 10 out of 10",1,this is probably the best television show ive ever seen  i first saw it on comedy central several years ago  at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order  and having just watched all three series in order and unedited  thank you internet and your wondrous  series of tubes   i am so glad i rediscovered it  i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a  season       and i tried to get friends and family to watch it  but nobody really seemed to like it  i need new friends   so  on my own  i made the best out of it that i could  even when i felt like it was waning a bit  i still felt compelled to continue watching  years after when i discovered little britain  i immediately recognized pauline from log as having influenced marjorie in fat fighters  also  i love the idea of writers who act the entire show     not new  but done impeccably here   lb has nothing on log   no offense  matt   david    love you   this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius  serial murder  implied cannibalism     you name it and its probably found in this wonderful  unique piece of tv art  the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of royston vasey     youll never leave  i think my favorite character would have to be tubbs  but each character as portrayed has its own  charm   my least favorite was papa lazarous  that was until he re surfaced in series three  clever and wholly unexpected   its best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before  becomes so compelling  while repulsing  that you really cant stop watching  this is not for those with weak stomachs  kids  conservatives or grandma  unless youve got one saucy granny   i have always loved british tv  particularly comedies  from monty python to benny hill  red dwarf to keeping up appearances  absolutely fabulous and the british originals coupling and the office  but not their us counterparts    sorry   this is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between whats funny and whats just sick and twisted  nothing  nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment  us broadcast tv is so sad and lame  i can barely stand to watch any of it  its kind of sad that even our cable channels dont have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem  your loss  comedy central   thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the  across the pond  that redeem the entire medium every decade or so  basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently  crossing lines  with more graphic sexual content  drug use and adult language  but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life  adult behavior  instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up  sheesh  its like the same basic show format for the past 35 years   dont even get me started on us sitcoms  waste of time and lots of wasted money      did you know that  according to jim  has been on the air for 10 years    10 years   anyway    watch this show  get it on dvd  do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well  youve never seen anything like it  there are three specials that i have not watched yet    im saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits  hell watch them  even if i have to chain him up and paint him with excrement  lines and lines and lines and lines  note that series three departs from one and two    the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters  the laugh track is gone  thank bloody hell   the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of royston vasey  dont be thrown by any of that as by the end  the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two  i think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable  brilliant  confident and absolutely demented  you will want to re watch it again and again  its amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close up facial expression  if ever i were to meet any of the writer performers  id implore them not to recreate it or try to top it     id just say  can i help you at all    then theyd probably slap me  so id ask them to sign the slap mark   10 out of 10
"Winchester '73 was the film that moved Mann from the b-movies to the big league, rescuing James Stewart's floundering post-war career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero (although since he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, maybe Lang deserves the credit for that). Both men would go to much darker places - Mann with the remarkably bleak Devil's Doorway, which remained shelved by MGM until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it  but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the director's beloved mountainside shootouts is still stronger meat than you'd expect from the studio system. Great dialogue, an impressive supporting cast  Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them  and Mann's outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one.",1,winchester 73 was the film that moved mann from the b movies to the big league  rescuing james stewarts floundering post war career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero  although since he inherited the project from fritz lang  maybe lang deserves the credit for that   both men would go to much darker places   mann with the remarkably bleak devils doorway  which remained shelved by mgm until the success of broken arrow convinced them to release it  but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the directors beloved mountainside shootouts is still stronger meat than youd expect from the studio system  great dialogue  an impressive supporting cast  dan duryea  will geer  millard mitchell  stephen mcnally  shelley winters  charles drake  tim mcintire  jay c  flippen  tony curtis  rock hudson among them  and manns outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one 
"Relying on the positive reviews above, we saw a free screening of this last night. Now I KNOW that filmmakers plant positive reviews, because there is no way an objective individual could have written these. ""Destined to become a 'cult classic'""?? The theater was packed, apparently with friends and families of the production crew, because only a few of us walked out by the first hour.<br /><br />The songs were the most literal I've ever heard in a musical  ""don't take the short cut, honey, there's a wolf in the woods.."". Debi Mazar's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines.<br /><br />Now, whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, ex N'Syncer, living up to his last name as he's not aged well. He's not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school-quality makeup and out-of-tune singing. Seriously, this guy was in vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate, but can't do much about the unimaginative script.

"Time for Hollywood to sit up and take notice! If the actors are acting snooty, all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel.

"I've watched this documentary twice - and although I'm an major movie buff, most documentaries don't hold my attention. This film however was mesmerizing. Almost every shot is perfect - saying so much more than an audio commentary (which this documentary does not have).<br /><br />The concept of this film is amazing, I can't praise it enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought?? <br /><br />Amazing and excellent choices of interviews - film footage of a factory in China - the film makes you feel like you are actually there.<br /><br />I'm political aware - and I've read several books on globalization so there wasn't anything in this film that was a surprise to me. However, it's made me think so much. <br /><br />I wish so much too, that this world was a better place.<br /><br />A million kudos to the filmmaker - and thanks for making this film too.<br /><br />I wish everyone could see it.",1,ive watched this documentary twice   and although im an major movie buff  most documentaries dont hold my attention  this film however was mesmerizing  almost every shot is perfect   saying so much more than an audio commentary  which this documentary does not have   the concept of this film is amazing  i cant praise it enough  mardi gras beads   who would have thought    amazing and excellent choices of interviews   film footage of a factory in china   the film makes you feel like you are actually there  im political aware   and ive read several books on globalization so there wasnt anything in this film that was a surprise to me  however  its made me think so much   i wish so much too  that this world was a better place  a million kudos to the filmmaker   and thanks for making this film too  i wish everyone could see it 
"1st watched 6/18/2009  2 out of 10 (Dir- Pete Riski): Weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital, the power flickers, and then all hell breaks loose. I'm honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one. What we get for the next 1 hour and a half(at least it wasn't longer) was a twisted horror/twilight zone/zombiefest/ghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end. Initially, after the power goes out, everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father. There is the typical annoying character, a creepy old man, and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and, of course, the young girl the main character gets attracted to. Random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing, a hinting that time has stopped, and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever they're in. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and I really hate how they used this girl's affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame. We never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer. What a waste of timereally!!",0,1st watched 6 18 2009  2 out of 10  dir  pete riski   weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital  the power flickers  and then all hell breaks loose  im honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one  what we get for the next 1 hour and a half at least it wasnt longer  was a twisted horror twilight zone zombiefest ghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end  initially  after the power goes out  everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father  there is the typical annoying character  a creepy old man  and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and  of course  the young girl the main character gets attracted to  random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing  a hinting that time has stopped  and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever theyre in  of course  the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and i really hate how they used this girls affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame  we never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange  so please avoid this dog  unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer  what a waste of timereally  
"I have walked out of very few movies before they end, but I couldn't finish this piece of garbage. This was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since ""Birth of a Nation"". The characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I don't see how any actor would want their name associated with this film. Lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this. I know that I and anyone with a brain have better things to do.... like watching paint dry. I wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically. There is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like Lee.",0,i have walked out of very few movies before they end  but i couldnt finish this piece of garbage  this was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since  birth of a nation   the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts  i dont see how any actor would want their name associated with this film  lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this  i know that i and anyone with a brain have better things to do     like watching paint dry  i wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically  there is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like lee 
"Yes, this was pure unbelievable condescending babble. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of the USA, it's puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT ONE ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas station, no Tvs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... A population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other. The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy? HELP! I am so baffled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer on what to avoid. Gosh, I hope I didn't ruin it for you!",0,yes  this was pure unbelievable condescending babble  we know that the french often have a skewed idea of the usa  its puritanism and views towards sex  as an american  hoosier  who lives in france  i have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes  and while some of these preconceived notions may be true  not one element of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real  a man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big  where in the world would you find that  a juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass  a town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from chicago  but with no major gas station  no tvs in the home  no mcdonalds  no kids    a population that knows each others intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other  the adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe  have farms but dont harvest  kill the guy they dont like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it  and all with equal emotion  the liberated french girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity  the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy  help  i am so baffled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that i am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is  go see it for the a to z primer on what to avoid  gosh  i hope i didnt ruin it for you 
"""The Kennel Murder Case"" starts off at a run and doesn't stop until the very end. Everybody had reason to kill the victim, and several people tried. William Powell is terrific as Philo Vance, gentleman detective. Mary Astor is refreshing as the put-upon niece who only wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance. This movie comes paired with ""Nancy Drew, Reporter"" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent the disc (or check it out from your local library), do it. It's pure entertainment!",1, the kennel murder case  starts off at a run and doesnt stop until the very end  everybody had reason to kill the victim  and several people tried  william powell is terrific as philo vance  gentleman detective  mary astor is refreshing as the put upon niece who only wants to marry her scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance  this movie comes paired with  nancy drew  reporter  on dvd  which is also fun  if you have to rent the disc  or check it out from your local library   do it  its pure entertainment 
"... It even beats the nasty ""raw"". Almost twenty years old is this show and still I laughed VERY MUCH when I was watching it last night. It shows Eddie Murphy dressed in tight red clothes(Old School)and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family. He was only 22-years old then and this is a must-see!<br /><br />8/10",1,    it even beats the nasty  raw   almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night  it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothes old school and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family  he was only 22 years old then and this is a must see  8 10
